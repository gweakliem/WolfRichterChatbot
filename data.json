The Bank of Canada has raised its overnight rate to 5.0% and reduced pandemic QE assets due to inflation concerns, particularly in the rental market from increased immigration.

Housing components, including Rent of Primary Residence and Owners' Equivalent of Rent, continued to rise steadily.

Dimon emphasized the need for businesses and investors to prepare for a range of potential outcomes rather than relying on specific forecasts due to the unpredictable nature of geopolitical and economic forces. Factors contributing to potential inflation included ongoing fiscal spending, remilitarization, global trade restructuring, green economy capital needs, and higher energy costs. Ben warned about the importance of being ready for interest rates ranging from 2% to 8% or even higher, as different economic scenarios could unfold. He also cautioned about the potential stress on the banking system and leveraged companies if long-term rates exceed 6% during a recession. Concerns were raised about the risks associated with quantitative easing and tightening, with a focus on the significant liquidity drainage through QT exceeding $900 billion annually, representing an unprecedented scale of quantitative tightening."

Ben discusses the challenges of withdrawing liquidity and the potential end of QT based on settlement balances, potentially aligning with September 2025. The Bank of Canada's major liabilities, including bank notes in circulation, government deposits, and bank settlement balances, play key roles in shaping the QT process. Once QT concludes, a transition to short-term T-bills and term repos will reshape the balance sheet composition over a multi-year period."
