        "summary": "In an article by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET, household debt trends surrounding mortgages, delinquencies, and foreclosures, particularly focusing on the resurgence of HELOC loans, were discussed. Mortgage balances hit a record high in Q1, with HELOC balances also seeing a significant rise. The burden of mortgage debt, measured against disposable income, has remained relatively steady, despite recent increases in income. Delinquency rates for mortgages and HELOCs have not yet normalized post-pandemic, and foreclosures are gradually increasing from pandemic lows. Foreclosures may not be a critical issue as long as home prices remain stable and homeowners stay employed, although a sudden mass selling of homes could create problems. Banks are not as exposed to mortgage risks this time around, with most mortgages now held by government entities, reducing the potential for a financial system collapse stemming from failing mortgages."

These exchanges offer an alternative to traditional bankruptcy court restructurings, allowing companies to negotiate with creditors and potentially swap out debt for equity. This trend reflects the challenges faced by highly leveraged companies in the current economic environment. Distressed debt exchanges significantly increase default numbers when included in default rates, with investors motivated by loose financial conditions to engage in these deals. Leveraged loans, popular among junk-rated companies, have led to a surge in exchanges since the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates. Despite rising defaults due to borrowers struggling with higher interest payments, leveraged-loan issuance has increased, while distressed debt exchanges remain prevalent in the junk bond realm."

This move is seen as a way to boost the mortgage industry post-refinance-mortgage collapse, with Freddie Mac proposing to securitize these mortgages for investor appeal. However, this strategy poses risks for homeowners, especially in declining markets where they may struggle with dual mortgage payments and potential personal liabilities for deficiencies on both mortgages. Despite the irony of homeowners paying fees on their own money, the industry sees this as a way to tap into the immense pool of home equity and foster growth."

Wolf Richter notes the surge in bond sales this week exceeding $14 billion, showing companies' eagerness to quickly meet funding needs with stable interest rate expectations. Corporate bond issuance has increased by 38% since the beginning of 2024, with junk bonds reaching $117 billion, reflecting loose financial conditions despite the Fed's unchanged policy rates at 5.5% since July 2023."

Vacasa's restructuring process, led by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET, revealed a $141 million loss in its latest earnings report due to softening demand and rising competition. Revenue fell by 18% in Q1 and by 6% in 2023 compared to the previous year, prompting multiple rounds of layoffs and restructuring to reduce costs. Despite efforts to stabilize its financial situation, the company continues to struggle with mounting losses and underwent a reverse stock split to avoid delisting, with shares dropping 97% since the SPAC merger."

The company, known for giving Wolf Street a downgrade to \"Should Have Never Bought\" in their brand safety services, acts as a mediator between advertisers and internet publishers, offering services with dubious claims. Following a decrease in revenue guidance, DoubleVerify experienced a 42% decrease in net income, resulting in a downgrade by Wolf Street. DoubleVerify's IPO in April 2021 coincided with a peak hype period, leading to a significant decline post-IPO.

QT details include slowing down and starting in June, with a Treasury cap adjustment to $25 billion and MBS runoff to continue at $35 billion, aiming for MBS to eventually disappear from the balance sheet. Treasury securities have decreased by $1.25 trillion, while MBS holdings dropped by $368 billion due to slower home sales and refinancing. The Discount Window provides liquidity to banks at 5.5% interest, with $6.8 billion in loans in April. The Bank Term Funding Program decreased to $124 billion and will phase out by March 2025.

Delinquencies on floating-rate office CMBS loans have reached 20%, while fixed-rate loans stand at a much lower 4.7%. The rise in delinquencies for floating-rate loans is attributed to landlords struggling with rising vacancies and interest rates. The shift from fixed-rate to floating-rate office loans as interest rates increased has further complicated the situation. The overall delinquency rates for CMBS loans show the office sector as the worst-performing category, with multifamily and industrial sectors faring better. Despite some challenges, concerns persist over repayment defaults for fixed-rate loans and oversupply in the office market.

Powell's emphasis on the possibility of rate hikes marks a significant departure from past discussions centered on rate cuts. The Federal Reserve would consider hiking rates if evidence suggests the current policy stance is not tight enough to bring inflation down to 2%. Powell expressed caution towards rate hikes, stating that it was unlikely the next move would be a hike. The Fed remains patient and cautious in considering rate cuts, taking a wait-and-see approach due to concerns about persistently low inflation. Powell highlighted the importance of gaining confidence in sustainable inflation reaching 2% before easing policy restrictions. The Fed's decision to slow Quantitative Tightening (QT) aims to ensure a smooth transition in reducing its balance sheet without causing market stress, with a plan to eventually eliminate Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) from the balance sheet entirely."

The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index for 20 metros saw a 0.9% increase from December-February, reaching a new high 0.4% above June 2022 levels. Although some cities like San Diego and Los Angeles surpassed their 2022 peaks by a small margin, San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle remained notably below, 12% and 10.6% respectively. Out of the 20 metros, only Tampa and Cleveland experienced a decline in home prices, with Seattle showing the highest monthly increase at 2.3%. San Francisco Bay Area single-family houses have shown +1.7% monthly and +5.7% yearly increases, but are down by -12.0% from the peak in May 2022. Miami stands out as the most splendid housing bubble with home price inflation of 329% since 2000, far exceeding the Consumer Price Index.

The semiconductor shortage led to a spike in vehicle prices followed by a significant drop, affecting firms like Hertz with massive write-downs. Maintenance and repair costs surged, reflected in the CPI, impacting consumers and fleet owners alike. Piling into EVs created issues as renters unfamiliar with them led to a reduced EV fleet for Hertz due to low demand, impacting residual values faster than ICE vehicles. The collision between inflated vehicle acquisition prices and rapid depreciation rates resulted in a $561 million quarterly loss for Hertz, causing share values to plummet and the company to be classified as an \"Imploded Stock.\""

        "summary": "In the Wolf Street article \"Money Market Funds, T-Bills, Large CDs, Small CDs: Americans Learn to Arbitrage the Higher-for-Longer Interest Rates,\" Wolf Richter discusses how Americans are capitalizing on higher interest rates by shifting their money into money market funds, Treasury bills, and CDs, avoiding unnecessary bank fees. Treasury bills under three months have been yielding over 5%, reflecting increased investor interest in short-term, low-risk investments backed by the Fed's rate hikes. As yields continue to rise, banks are compelled to offer competitive rates on CDs to retain and attract deposits, leading to a surge in large and small time-deposits. While T-bills have become popular among investors, banks are cautious about raising deposit rates to prevent a loyalty tax, despite customers having options to earn more elsewhere. This trend highlights the growing preference for secure yet lucrative investment alternatives over traditional bank accounts, as evidenced by the significant balances in retail money market funds reaching $6.36 trillion."

The drag from imports continues to impact long-term real GDP growth, with imports causing nearly 4 percentage points of damage in Q1, the worst since 1988.

The potential conversion of the tower into residential units indicates a new chapter, but Wolf notes the extended timeline for planning, permitting, and construction, signaling that full recovery may take years.

This drop has been further influenced by mortgage rate reductions, making new homes more appealing to buyers. Homeowners holding onto vacant properties in hopes of lower mortgage rates have caused a convergence in prices between new and existing single-family homes. The median price of new homes has fallen more than existing homes, leading to a historic low 5-7% price difference between the two types of properties. Despite high mortgage rates, sales of new houses have remained steady, seeing a modest increase in March compared to a year ago. In contrast, sales of existing homes have plummeted by 29% since January 2019. The abundance of new houses for sale, reaching levels not seen since 2008, indicates a potential surplus that could impact prices and demand in the housing market."

Going forward, the maturity schedule indicates that an additional $65 billion in GoC bonds will mature by September 2025 if Quantitative Tightening (QT) continues. Ben discusses the challenges of withdrawing liquidity and the potential end of QT based on settlement balances, potentially aligning with September 2025. The Bank of Canada's major liabilities, including bank notes in circulation, government deposits, and bank settlement balances, play key roles in shaping the QT process. Once QT concludes, a transition to short-term T-bills and term repos will reshape the balance sheet composition over a multi-year period."

        "summary": "In a recent article by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET, the European Central Bank (ECB) has significantly reduced its balance sheet by \u20ac2.2 trillion since the start of Quantitative Tightening (QT), reaching \u20ac6.61 trillion. This reduction amounts to shedding 25% of total assets and 53% of pandemic QE, marking a change in central banks' strategies amidst inflation pressures. Loan QT saw a reduction of \u20ac2.06 trillion or 93% from its peak, with only \u20ac156 billion in loans remaining. Bond QT resulted in a decrease of \u20ac369 billion from the peak, mainly from the APP program, lowering bond holdings to \u20ac4.60 trillion. The Fed and ECB collectively removed $4 trillion in liquidity, reflecting a shift in policy towards reducing liquidity in response to inflation."

        "summary": "In a recent article by Ben Thompson on Stratechery, Wolf Richter's piece for Wolf Street is highlighted. The 10-Year Yield Hits 4.40%, indicating the bond market's acknowledgment of higher inflation rates post-pandemic. This shift contrasts with a previous focus on rate cuts, and the possibility of the yield reaching 5% is now being discussed. The Federal Reserve's reluctance to crash the economy for 2% inflation implies a potential return to 1990s-level inflation, with recent economic growth and labor market strength hinting at a shift towards a more restrictive monetary policy."

        "summary": "In the article, Ben analyzes the recent jobs report, noting that the labor market is robust with 303,000 new payroll jobs created, exceeding expectations and indicating strong job growth. The household data, however, is affected by an underestimation of immigration by the Census Bureau, causing discrepancies in employment and labor force participation figures. Despite this, the total workforce from the household survey is higher than the employer payrolls data, partly due to the immigration miscalculations. The labor force increased by 469,000 to 167.9 million, with stable prime-age labor participation at 83.4%, and a decrease of 29,000 unemployed individuals. Ben delves into unemployment rates, trends among part-time workers, self-employed individuals, and multiple job holders, highlighting the overall soundness of the labor market and arguing against a Fed rate cut."
