        "summary": "In the Wolf Street article, the Federal Reserve's balance sheet for June decreased by $13 billion, reaching a total of $6.66 trillion, marking a $2.31 trillion reduction from its peak and signifying three years of quantitative tightening (QT) as the Fed aims to reduce assets gathered during periods of quantitative easing (QE). Despite the shrinkage, the balance sheet is considerably larger than pre-pandemic levels. The article highlights the Federal Reserve's QT assets, noting a $3.8 billion reduction in Treasury securities in June and a $1.56 trillion decrease since their peak in June 2022\u2014a 27% decline\u2014slowing down its Treasury securities QT to about $5 billion monthly. Additionally, the Federal Reserve handles Treasury maturities, reinvestment, and roll-off by limiting roll-off to $5 billion per month and reinvesting the rest. A specified strategy involves upcoming Treasury maturities with designated reinvestment and roll-off figures for the next few months. The Federal Reserve's holdings of Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) have decreased significantly since their pandemic peak, declining steadily at $14-18 billion per month, with excess reductions being offset by reinvestments in Treasury securities to cap QT at $40 billion monthly. The Bank liquidity facilities, including the Central Bank Liquidity Swaps, the Standing Repo Facility (SRF), and the Discount Window, showed minimal activity in June. The SRF, utilized for one day with a balance of $11 billion, was upgraded to include a morning auction alongside the existing afternoon auction to allow banks to profit from rate spreads, aiming to prevent repo market disruptions."

        "summary": "\nThe Wolf Street article titled \"Beneath the Surface of the Employment Report: How Jobs Evolved by Industry over Time, Winners & Losers\" by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET delves into the disparities in job creation across various industries within a generally strong job market and historically low unemployment rates. The \"Jobs Report\" outlines a total nonfarm payroll increase by 147,000 in June, leading to 159.6 million jobs, with the three-month average indicating a strengthening employment trend. Wage growth showed a 0.22% increase in June and 3.7% year-over-year, suggesting steady worker compensation improvement. In the \"Jobs by Major Industry over time\" section, employment is categorized based on primary activities. Healthcare and social assistance hit new highs, while state and local governments employ significantly in education and healthcare. Professional and business services recovered from previous over-hiring, and leisure and hospitality reached record levels. In contrast, retail trade stagnated due to e-commerce, and manufacturing plateaued at 12.75 million jobs thanks to automation. Financial activities and construction broke employment records, while transportation and warehousing slightly grew and wholesale trade declined. Other services, information, arts, entertainment, and recreation sectors showed minor growth, whereas the federal government employment fell to its lowest since 1939. Oil, gas, mining, and logging remained low, enhanced by technological efficiencies, with utilities sector employment growing slightly. These sections collectively highlight the diverse growth trends, structural changes, and technological impacts on industries, despite the overall health of the employment market."

        "summary": "In an article by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street, new vehicle sales in the U.S. during the second quarter improved, marking the best Q2 results since 2021, despite challenges faced by manufacturers like Stellantis, Nissan, and Tesla. Tesla notably struggled with the Cybertruck, which could become a costly failure due to delays and production issues. The momentum of the market rebounded but slowed in June. The article features the section \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET,\" noting that June vehicle sales decreased by 4.2% compared to the previous year, partly due to fewer selling days and the impact of a CDK hack that disrupted sales in June 2024. The seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of vehicle sales increased year-over-year by 2.3% in June, though it had been falling for three consecutive months. Despite a robust performance earlier in the year, boosted by factors like tax refunds, these drivers largely dissipated by June. \"Stellantis, Nissan & Tesla drag down Q2 sales\" discusses shifts among automakers, highlighting General Motors' 7.3% sales increase and its doubling of electric vehicle sales, making it the second-largest EV seller in the U.S. Ford and Chrysler faced declines in EV sales due to pricing and content origin issues, while Stellantis experienced a 10% decline across most brands. Tesla faced a downturn in global sales, with Cybertruck sales dropping over 51%, underscoring potential issues for the model. The overall market outlook for the rest of the year remains mixed as inventory levels and consumer demand continue to be uncertain factors."

        "summary": "In the Wolf Street article \"Office CMBS Delinquency Rate Spikes to Record 11.1% in June, Worse than Financial Crisis Meltdown Peak, after 3-Month Relapse,\" authored by Wolf Richter, it is reported that the office CMBS delinquency rate hit an unprecedented high of 11.1% in June, exceeding the peaks observed during the financial crisis and December 2024. This increase is indicative of an ongoing downturn in the office real estate sector, despite earlier predictions that the worst was over. Of the $156 billion in securitized office loans, institutional investors, including bond funds and insurers, hold them, while banks are not directly exposed. In June alone, $1.8 billion in office CMBS loans became delinquent; however, $1 billion was \"cured\" through court intervention or financial tactics, resulting in a net increase of $800 million in delinquency. The section \"The top three June additions to the 'delinquent' balance\" highlights notable properties contributing to this spike, such as the 42-story One California Plaza in Los Angeles, which went into foreclosure over a $300 million mortgage; JEMB Realty\u2019s 75 Broad Street in New York City, which became delinquent on a $176 million loan; and Federal Center Plaza in Washington, DC, with a $130 million default contributing significantly to a particular CMBS portfolio's delinquency rate. The article's section \"The top three delinquent loans that were \u2018cured\u2019 and came off the list\" explains the resolution of significant delinquent loans. This includes Martin Selig's portfolio in Seattle, transferred to a custodial receiver, rendering it no longer delinquent; the 1000 Wilshire Boulevard property in Los Angeles, which Cerberus Capital Management cured following a default; and a Fifth Avenue property in New York whose loan was extended to 2026 by the Chetrit Organization to cure its delinquency through an \"extend and pretend\" strategy."

        "summary": "In the article titled \"Tariff Cash Is Rolling In: June\u2019s Record Take Spikes by $20.5 Billion Year-over-Year\" by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street, there is a detailed discussion on the U.S. government's record collection of $20.5 billion from tariffs in June, marking a significant year-over-year increase. This revenue surge is mainly due to businesses absorbing tariff costs rather than passing them on to consumers, resulting in stable consumer prices. In the section \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET,\" Richter highlights that if the trend continues, annual customs and excise tax revenues could potentially reach about $250 billion. Despite businesses attempting to shift costs to consumers, consumer price inflation for durable goods remained stagnant. This period of hefty profits for nonfinancial corporations, driven by high consumer spending and sustained even with tariffs, allows companies like GM (presumably General Motors) and Nike to absorb these costs. Additionally, companies might avoid tariffs by relocating production to the U.S., which aligns with tariff objectives, potentially benefiting the domestic economy with increased production and tax revenues. However, these shifts will take time and entail significant challenges."

        "summary": "The article \"Underlying Labor Market Dynamics Are Solid, Recession Stays on the Back Burner\" on Wolf Street, authored by Wolf Richter, outlines the resilience of the labor market, which remains robust amidst various economic challenges and fluctuations. The piece emphasizes that companies do not simply cease operations abruptly, maintaining strength and adaptability in the employment landscape despite federal job issues, tariffs, and media concerns about the economy. In May, job openings surged, aligning with pre-pandemic levels and reflecting a healthy market without the extreme shortages witnessed in 2021-2022. This rise in openings is largely due to vacancies from workers quitting or being discharged, rather than new positions. Layoffs and discharges have hit their lowest since August 2024, indicating company stability. Many workers leaving jobs are looking for better opportunities, boosting \"quits\" in May and demonstrating confidence in finding improved prospects. While hiring in May slightly dipped from its April peak, it remains robust, mainly filling past vacancies rather than new roles. This reflects a strong, dynamic labor market with less churn than in previous high-turnover years, marking stability and a low likelihood of recession."

        "summary": "The article, \"Exit from the \u201cLock-in\u201d Effect Slowed in Q1 as Home Sales Deteriorated Further and Supply Spiked\" by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET, discusses the significant cooling of the housing market in the first quarter, marked by a notable decline in home sales and an increase in unsold supply. Homeowners previously benefitting from the \"lock-in\" effect of low-interest rates on their existing mortgages faced challenges as demand fell and the ability to complete sales waned. There was a modest decline in the proportion of mortgages under 3%, with a 30 basis point fall, indicating a weakening lock-in effect. Ultra-low-rate mortgages appeared during the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing measures, which dramatically reduced mortgage rates between mid-2020 and October 2021, a temporary phase in mortgage lending history. Housing market dynamics, now influenced by higher rates, point to a significant lock-in effect, affecting related sectors, resulting in job cuts in the real estate and mortgage industries, encapsulating broader economic trends influenced by fiscal policies."

Under the section \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET,\" the article details how the 30-year Treasury yield has been rising since its low in mid-September 2024, creating a steepening yield curve and a historically wide spread to mortgage rates that signals market concerns. The section \"The spread between the 10-year Treasury yield and mortgage rates\" notes that the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate recently fell to 6.77%, expanding the gap with the 10-year Treasury yield to 2.46 percentage points, a trend occurring since the Federal Reserve's Quantitative Tightening (QT) began. This widening is influenced by the Fed's $2.3 trillion reduction in securities and the decrease in Mortgage-Backed Securities, indicating that wider spreads and higher mortgage rates may persist. The article suggests that the bond market faces challenges from high Treasury issuance amid budget deficits, with inflation and Federal Reserve policies heavily impacting yields. Despite Fed rate cuts, the 10-year Treasury yield has risen, highlighting the need for the Fed to carefully manage inflation to stabilize long-term yields and mortgage rates. The findings underscore the significance of these market shifts for borrowing costs, economic forecasts, and broader economic factors, requiring vigilant monitoring of bond market movements and central bank policies."

        "summary": "In his Wolf Street article, Wolf Richter examines the apparent drop in consumer income in May, which initially raised concerns about a potential recession. The section titled \"That Drop in Consumer Income in May Was a False Recession Alarm\" explains that the decrease was primarily due to a normalization of Social Security payments that had temporarily spiked in April as a result of policy changes. Despite this reversion, wages and salaries continued to grow robustly, indicating a strong labor market. In the section \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET,\" it is noted that personal income fell by 0.4%, the first decline since September 2021. However, wages and salaries continued to rise by 0.4% in May, marking a 4.9% increase year-over-year, while dividend and interest income remained stable at a $4.0 trillion annual rate. Proprietors\u2019 income from small businesses and farms fell by 2.3% in May but rose 2.3% year-over-year, highlighting the volatility in farm incomes. Rental income saw a slight decrease to a $1.1 trillion annual rate but was still up 3.9% compared to the previous year. These mixed signals underscore that the decline in personal income does not present a straightforward recessionary trend, as steady wage growth suggests the economy's resilience."

But Tariffs Haven\u2019t Shown Up Yet: Why the Fed Is in Wait-and-See Mode\" on Wolf Street, Wolf Richter discusses the recent trend in the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, which increased to an annualized rate of 2.8% over a six-month period, despite declining energy prices. The Fed's preferred measure for inflation, the PCE index, rose in May both month-to-month and year-over-year, with the core PCE index, excluding food and energy, reflecting similar upward movement. This deviates from the Fed's 2% inflation target. The article highlights the implications of tariffs which have yet to show up in the inflation figures, prompting the Federal Reserve to adopt a wait-and-see approach. In May, the PCE price index rose 2.3% year-over-year, slightly surpassing the Fed's target, with the core services PCE index increasing substantially by 3.3%. Durable goods saw a modest year-over-year rise of 0.5%, rebounding from previous declines, though no month-over-month change occurred, indicating tariffs have not yet affected prices. Month-over-month and on a 6-month basis in May, the PCE index showed a 0.14% increase from April, leading to a 1.6% annualized growth, with a 6-month acceleration of 2.8%. Core services PCE, excluding energy, rose by 0.16%, reflecting a 1.9% annualized rise, while housing inflation, influenced by rent changes, recorded a 0.26% increase and a 3.9% 6-month rise. Durable goods prices stabilized in May, showing no change from April, with a 1.4% 6-month annualized rise. The Fed remains attentive to how potential tariff costs might impact inflation, weighing whether companies will pass these costs onto consumers or absorb them as consumer behavior evolves against higher prices. This dynamic could affect durable goods prices and broader inflation trends moving forward."

An analysis of profits by major industry indicates certain sectors are more resilient or vulnerable to external pressures. During the high-inflation period from Q1 2020 to Q4 2024, pretax profits surged by 122% in nonfinancial industries and 97% in financial industries while CPI inflation increased by 23%. However, by Q1 2025, corporate profit growth stagnated, with nonfinancial industries growing by only 0.1% and financial industries by 0.2% due to price resistance as further price hikes risked sales loss. New tariffs introduced in April 2025 impacted corporate profits as they struggled to pass import costs onto consumers, though businesses still have profit buffers from earlier price hikes. In the section \"Corporate profits by major industry,\" the \"Other nonfinancial\" industries saw a 3.1% quarterly rise and a 7.3% annual increase, reaching an annual rate of $1.07 trillion. Manufacturing declined by 6.5% in Q1 but had a 4.8% annual uptick, retail trade profits grew by 1.0% quarterly and 10.5% annually, while information sectors recorded a 3.9% quarterly and 27.6% annual increase. Wholesale trade profits edged up by 0.8% in Q1 and 2.3% annually, and transportation and warehousing profits rose by 1.4% in Q1 and 3.0% annually. These figures, adjusted for inventory valuation and capital consumption, highlight significant growth trends across industries since 2020."

Homebuilders are experiencing declining sales, with Lennar, a major firm, seeing its average sales price fall to its lowest since Q2 2020. This situation reflects a reversal of previous price hikes from 2020-2022 and presents difficulties for homeowners looking to sell. Highlighted in the section \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET\", the demand for new homes, despite an oversupply, is mostly due to aggressive pricing strategies and incentives like mortgage-rate buydowns. Homebuilders are reducing costs and profit margins to remain competitive, as seen in the section titled \"But incentives are not included in the median price by the Census Bureau\", where Lennar's incentive spending surged to 13.3% of revenues, impacting average sales prices that fell 19.5% in Q2 2025 compared to Q2 2022. The Census Bureau reports a slight decrease in median contract price since incentives are excluded. The section \"Inventory for sale by region\" outlines a record high of 311,000 inventories in the South, spearheaded by Texas and Florida, where sales dropped 16% YOY, leading to a 10-month supply. In contrast, the West saw inventories at 110,000 with sales rising to 15,000, a 7% YOY increase. The Midwest's inventory rose to 49,000, while the Northeast's inventory decreased to 31,000, both showing increases from the previous year.

Single-Family Home Sales Below 1995, Supply Highest since 2016,\" the Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter details a severe downturn in the Canadian real estate market, characterized by plummeting sales of condos and single-family homes alongside an increasing surplus in supply. In the first section, \"A Condo Bust is Unfolding,\" it reports a significant decline in condo sales, with figures hitting a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 360,000 in May, marking the lowest since 2012 and similar to levels during May 2020's lockdown, while condo supply rose to a 6.7-month inventory, the highest since July 2012. The \"Single-family home sales still below 1995, supply spikes\" section shows single-family home sales remain at near-record lows, even lower than May 1995's data, despite a slight increase to an annual rate of 3.67 million. The supply of these homes reached a 4.6-month supply high, the largest since 2016, contradicting prior assumptions that scarcity was the sales bottleneck. Instead, unaffordable prices have dampened demand. In \"Median price for condos and single-family homes,\" the article observes that while median condo prices nationally rose a mere 0.3% from April to May, previously price spikes have led to reductions in many cities, with declines up to 23% from past peaks. Similarly, the median price for single-family homes increased to $427,800 in May, with a 1.3% year-over-year gain as of May. This follows a previous 50% median price surge from June 2019 to June 2022, now tapering off with declines of 8% to 22% in major cities like Austin, San Francisco, and Washington D.C. The article outlines a broader market correction and stabilization phase facilitated by prior favorable conditions such as low interest rates, now met with demand destruction due to excessively inflated prices, limiting buyer activity, and triggering price adjustments."

Additional areas such as Washington D.C., Denver, Portland, Phoenix, Fort Worth, and San Antonio have also witnessed considerable decreases, the trends collectively reflecting a cooling market after a decade of explosive price growth."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter delves into the ownership and acquisition of U.S. national debt amid the Fed's reduction of its Treasury securities holdings in Q1, highlighting a shifting landscape among both domestic and international players. Foreign entities, particularly Japan and China, were significant buyers, although their historical investments show a selling trend, while U.S. banks reduced their holdings. This shift could impact U.S. fiscal policy and global financial stability. At the end of Q1, $36.2 trillion in Treasuries were held by various entities, with U.S. government entities alone accounting for $7.3 trillion. When the government sells Treasuries, they act as liabilities for the government but assets for investors, fluctuating in value with yield changes. By the end of Q1, the market value of public-held debt was $26.88 trillion, down $1.57 billion from face value. Foreign holdings, at market value, reached $9.01 trillion, 33.5% of the public-held debt. Despite prominent past roles, China and Japan's influence as U.S. debt holders is waning as European nations and other regions increase their share. Notably, the Euro Area, including Luxembourg, Belgium, and Ireland, has nearly doubled its holdings compared to China and Hong Kong, whose holdings are now $1.0 trillion. Canada increased its holdings significantly post-pandemic but recently saw a sharp decline. Other entities like Taiwan have increased their holdings, while India and Brazil show mild decreases. Among U.S. holders, mutual funds, ETFs, and money market funds held $5.02 trillion, with money market funds alone accounting for $2.88 trillion. The Federal Reserve, amid quantitative tightening, held $3.83 trillion, insurance companies increased their holdings to $3.05 trillion, and banks and financial firms together held $2.28 trillion. State and local governments held $1.61 trillion in Treasuries, US pension funds had $972 billion, while nonfinancial businesses held $246 billion. The diversification away from traditional key players to a varied global array reflects significant shifts in U.S. Treasury security holdings."

The downturn represents the unwinding of a massive bubble fueled by previously low interest rates that had driven prices up by as much as 350% in some areas until their peak between mid-2020 and mid-2022. The section \"This is what a condo bust in-progress looks like\" details the drop in condo prices across several U.S. cities, like Oakland and Austin, which have seen decreases of 23%, returning prices to levels from previous years. San Francisco has suffered a 15% dip, and Boise, Idaho's condo prices fell by 14%. High pricing, increased fees, and Fannie Mae's Condo Blacklist are making financing difficult, while an oversupply of rental condos and declining demand for vacation rentals add to the challenges. Successful sellers are aggressively cutting prices to attract buyers, leading to market volatility. The analysis based on Zillow Home Value Index data indicates widespread slumps in condo markets, illustrating a broader trend of diminishing real estate values from their peaks."

Inflation projections now foresee headline PCE inflation hitting 3.0% by the end of 2025, with core PCE inflation reaching 3.1%, indicating challenges in reaching the 2.0% target. The FOMC has also reduced GDP growth forecasts to 1.4% for 2025, with unemployment expected to rise to 4.5%, reflecting a cautious perspective on economic expansion amid active quantitative tightening and ongoing assessment of economic uncertainties.\n"

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article, penned by Wolf Richter, delves into the seemingly paradoxical trend of retail sales exhibiting resilience despite widespread negative consumer sentiment. In the section \"My Thoughts about those Retail Sales,\" Richter observes that consumer spending hasn't significantly declined, which signals robust purchasing behavior amidst economic uncertainties. The article notes that retail sales in May dipped by 0.9% from April, with minor fluctuations in earlier months; however, overall sales were up 3.5% compared to the previous year. Despite these fluctuations, May's sales, not seasonally adjusted, showed a notable increase from April, reaching $753 billion. This increase was partly influenced by seasonal adjustments due to an additional selling day. Vehicle sales, which constitute 19% of total retail, saw seasonal dips yet remained high historically, propelled by factors like tax refunds and potential tariff concerns. The piece also highlights the rise in ecommerce and nonstore retail sales by 6.3% year-over-year, showcasing strong growth amid economic challenges. Other sectors, including food services, experienced variations between unadjusted and seasonally adjusted figures, with gasoline prices influencing sales due to crude oil price shifts. Nevertheless, consumer spending remains strong, buoyed by employment growth, wage increases, and cash reserves."

        "summary": "In Wolf Richter's article \"Money-Market Funds & CDs: Americans and their Piles of Interest-Earning Cash,\" he discusses the emerging trend of Americans reallocating their funds toward money-market funds (MMFs), largely due to their attractive \"real\" yields of around 2% after adjusting for inflation. As outlined in the section Money-Market Funds & CDs, households have notably increased their MMF balances by $115 billion in the first quarter and $696 billion year-over-year, totaling $4.62 trillion. This growth is attributed to the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes, which have enhanced the yields on MMFs to about 4.2%, making them appealing to investors. The total MMF balances, including institutional holdings, have reached $7.40 trillion. Conversely, certificates of deposit (CDs) have become less popular, with small time deposits remaining stable at $1.06 trillion despite previously surging to $1.19 trillion by August 2024. Large time deposits over $100,000 decreased to $2.36 trillion in recent months but had still grown by $943 billion since March 2022 due to rising interest rates. In the section authored by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street, he highlights how banks have witnessed fluctuations in deposit levels, with overall deposits stabilizing at $18.1 trillion, pre-interest rate hike levels. The rise in CD balances from early 2022 to early 2023 reflects a withdrawal from savings and transaction accounts as customers pursued higher returns. Nonetheless, the allure of MMFs continues to grow, driven by higher interest rates and their perception as safer, yet profitable, investments in a tighter monetary policy environment."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article, written by Wolf Richter, focuses on a critical recession indicator, exploring how current economic data from mid-June suggests the U.S. is not yet in a recession, but emphasizes the importance of closely monitoring conditions. Titled \"Recession Watch: My Favorite Recession Indicator, Mid-June Update,\u201d the article highlights volatility in economic forecasting since trends have reversed before, raising uncertainty about future conditions. The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), responsible for declaring recessions, marks them by broad economic declines, including rising unemployment, which hasn't occurred yet. However, Insured Unemployment is identified as a key indicator, as it includes those filing for and retaining unemployment benefits, with historical recessions occurring when levels exceed 2.5 million. Although current figures are below this threshold, a concerning trend is emerging with a rise in the four-week moving average of Insured Unemployment, despite low job cuts and employment growth, suggesting newly laid-off workers are struggling to find jobs. The article underscores the importance of this data, which serves as an early systemic job loss indicator, offering a timelier and more accurate recession signal than NBER's declarations without survey-based biases. A four-week moving average is used to smooth out data inconsistencies due to state reporting irregularities, ensuring transient anomalies don't distort broader unemployment trends, making it a vital measure to anticipate economic downturns."

        "summary": "In the Wolf Street article, \"Tariff-Inflation Watch: CPI Inflation in Light of the Tariffs,\" Wolf Richter explores the impact of tariffs on consumer prices, particularly focusing on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) regarding durable goods, clothing, and footwear. Despite the increase in tariffs, there are no clear signs that costs are being passed on to consumers in these sectors. This indicates that companies may be absorbing the costs, or they are finding alternative supply chains and manufacturing adjustments. The durable goods CPI remains unchanged, even with a $23 billion increase in tariff revenue, suggesting companies are absorbing the impact rather than transferring it to consumers. Apparel and footwear CPI has decreased, further supporting this trend. However, the core services CPI has risen, highlighting consumers' limited power to resist price increases in essential services. This is in contrast with the slight deceleration of core CPI, excluding volatile food and energy prices. Overall, the general CPI saw a slight rise, but there is no substantial evidence of tariffs affecting consumer prices yet. During the pandemic, increased corporate profits might have played a role in absorbing these tariffs. Consequently, if consumers resist price hikes, those profits could offset the annual tariff costs and prevent further inflationary effects."

The article highlights that the surge in inventory\u2014primarily due to a drop in sales rather than an increase in new listings\u2014is leading to higher unsold inventory levels, as reflected in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach area and other major metro locations like Tampa, Orlando, and Jacksonville. In the section \"There\u2019s no problem here that prices cannot solve,\" Richter discusses how steeply increased housing prices, such as the 65% rise for mid-tier condos in Tampa from 2020 to 2022, are driving demand destruction by deterring buyers. Yet, the market is self-correcting, exemplified by Tampa's condo prices reducing by 11% from their peak. This price adjustment is crucial in addressing diminished demand, as similarly observed in California\u2019s housing market, where increased inventories have been noted in cities like San Diego and Los Angeles. Overall, the article underscores the self-regulating nature of the housing market, depicting how high prices, reduced demand, and increased supply could eventually restore equilibrium."

This surge in EV penetration highlights the impact of domestically versus overseas manufactured vehicles, with tariffs only affecting foreign content costs and giving an advantage to US-made models like the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y. Despite a shifting market where non-Tesla EVs outsold Tesla in California for two consecutive quarters, Tesla's Model Y and Model 3 continue to dominate the market with high percentages of US content. The article, titled \"Despite Tesla\u2019s Sales Drop, Total EV Penetration in the US Rises to Record 9.8%,\" details how US-made content in vehicles plays a role in tariff applications and competitive pricing as more models enter the market with varying US content levels. The next section, \"Lease, loan, or cash: Monthly payments for the top 10 EVs,\" discusses the popularity of leasing due to generally lower monthly payments compared to loans, aided by a federal rebate loophole for leased EVs. This section also covers the financing strategies of various manufacturers, with Honda's Prologue being predominantly leased, while Tesla's Model Y is mainly loan-financed, and the Cybertruck has a notably high cash purchase rate. Overall, the article illuminates the dynamics influencing consumer choices in the growing EV sector, from manufacturing origin to financing options."

It highlights the financial struggles and market corrections that have caused key players in the solar sector to reevaluate their financial landscapes and investment strategies. One notable example mentioned in the \"By Wolf Street\" section is Sunnova Energy International, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy due to accumulating $8.5 billion in debt against only $840 million in revenues for 2024. Despite such setbacks, solar power now contributes nearly 7% of the total US electricity, surpassing hydropower, and advancements in utility-scale batteries present profitable prospects in managing electricity price volatility. In the \"Stock market solar craziness\" section, the article details the issues faced by companies like SunPower, SolarEdge Technologies, Sunrun, Enphase Energy, Shoals Technologies, and Array Technologies, which, after experiencing a pandemic-fueled stock surge, are now enduring significant financial losses and stock value declines. This highlights broader market adjustments and the volatility and risks tied to speculative investor enthusiasm that previously buoyed these solar companies. Major players like Tesla remain involved in solar endeavors, while specialized companies with extensive employee bases and revenues face marked stock declines, reflecting the ongoing transition in the energy landscape, the importance of technological advancements, and infrastructural integration challenges in the solar sector."

        "summary": "The article titled \"Inventory of Homes for Sale in Biggest California Markets Suddenly Piles Up to Highest in Years: Demand Has Collapsed\" on Wolf Street by Wolf Richter highlights the deteriorating housing demand in California, leading to a surge in active listings in major markets. The article details that year-over-year, there has been a significant increase in listings with San Diego up by 66%, Los Angeles by 47%, and Orange County by 79%. Riverside-San Bernadino, San Jose and Silicon Valley, San Francisco metro, Sacramento, and Fresno also saw upticks of 51%, 56%, 40%, 55%, and 42%, respectively. This surge in listings reflects a shift from an earlier housing shortage to an oversupply situation since 2016, notably spiking in May 2025, marking this May as the second highest since 2016. The \"By Wolf Richter\" section emphasizes the synchronized pattern of accumulating active listings across regions like San Francisco-Oakland-Fremont, San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, and Sacramento-Roseville-Folsom. The collapse in demand is linked to unsustainably high prices from past monetary policies leading to demand destruction, as evidenced by plummeting pending home sales in the Western U.S., particularly with an 8.9% drop from March to April and a 41% decrease compared to 2019. The article suggests that to counteract this, sellers must reduce prices to stimulate demand once again."

In May, the balance sheet decreased by $36 billion to $6.67 trillion, marking the lowest level since April 2020, and $2.29 trillion, or 25.6%, has been shed since its peak, aligning with efforts to control inflation and manage economic growth. Under the \"QT assets\" section, the article notes the Fed's reduction of Treasury securities, now down to $4.21 trillion, and a pause in the rapid removal of Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) due to reduced mortgage payoffs, though a monthly decrease of $14-17 billion persists. The \"Bank liquidity facilities: inactive\" section reports minimal activity in the Fed's three facilities, with the Central Bank Liquidity Swaps, Standing Repo Facility, and Discount Window displaying substantially lower usage compared to their previous peaks. The \"What else contributed to the $36 billion decline in assets?\" section attributes the reduction to various factors including shifts in Treasury and MBS holdings, lower Discount Window borrowing, and accounting adjustments like reduced \"other assets\" and unamortized premiums. In \"Not another repo-market blowout, please,\" the article addresses the Fed's learning from prior dislocations in its assets-to-GDP ratio during QE and QT phases and emphasizes proactive measures like the revitalized Standing Repo Facility (SRF) to manage market liquidity and prevent disruptions. Notably, plans for dual auction sessions starting in 2025 aim to avert another potential repo market strain. Overall, the Fed's cautious QT pace seeks to ensure a seamless liquidity transition without risking market stability."

Dutch megabank ING recently sold a large office property in San Francisco at a 75% discount from its original value, reflecting pressures to divest from high-risk CRE loans amid a deteriorating market, particularly in office spaces. Despite the property's steep price reduction, ING managed to mitigate its losses compared to original investors, who lost about $320 million in equity. The transaction underscores a broader trend where banks are keen on removing non-income-generating loans to pave the way for new profitable opportunities, a move echoed in the section written by Wolf. This need to offload distressed assets aligns with a market-wide \"extend and pretend\" strategy where banks extend loan terms to avoid defaults. According to Colliers, a notable $384 billion in loans maturing by 2025 were previously extended, highlighting the sector's challenges. Amidst this, banks like ING are setting aside substantial funds to cover expected CRE losses, a strategy affecting their income statements quarterly. Foreign banks, heavily invested in US CRE, particularly face these dynamics. The article also mentions that new investors are now aiming to enhance property value through upgrades and tenant deals, capitalizing on decreased property values post-COVID."

In the \"Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET\" section, it is detailed that mortgage applications for purchasing homes have decreased by 39% compared to 2019, indicating a significant drop in demand following an unprecedented surge in home prices over the past two years. This decrease in demand is attributed to potential buyers waiting for declines in home prices and improvements in affordability stemming from higher incomes or lower interest rates. Despite the stabilization of mortgage rates between 6.6% and 7.1%, which came after the Federal Reserve's interest rate adjustments due to inflation, the shift from historically low rates continues to hurt mortgage refinance applications. In the meantime, the \"Demand in the Housing Market Just Got Even Worse\" section highlights that supply is further increasing as homes stay listed longer, reaching levels not observed since 2016. This mounting backlog of unsold homes combined with sellers' reluctance to reduce prices exacerbates the mismatch between supply and demand, raising questions about when and how these imbalances will resolve. Consequently, the market is facing ongoing uncertainty with high inventory levels and a cautious buyer pool."

        "summary": "The article \"Hiring in the Private Sector Surges, Despite All Moaning & Groaning about the Economy or Whatever\" by Wolf Richter on Wolf Street discusses the surprising upward trend in private sector hiring despite widespread economic pessimism. Section \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET\" reveals that private sector hiring increased by 160,000 in April, reaching 5.21 million, the highest in a year. However, this growth mainly replaced departing workers rather than creating new positions. Private sector job openings rose to 6.54 million, largely due to worker departures, reflecting a robust labor market. The segment \"Quits in the private sector\" reports a decrease of 148,000 quits to 3.01 million, signifying employee reluctance to change jobs amid layoff concerns, contrasting with pandemic trends of high quits and wage inflation. \"Layoffs and discharges\" notes a slight increase to 1.71 million in April, yet still historically low relative to payroll size, indicating a return to stable labor conditions post-pandemic. The JOLTS data illustrate healthier labor turnover with fewer openings due to stabilizing employment and reduced quits, allowing employers more freedom in workforce adjustments without major disruptions. This overall resilience in employment suggests recovery despite ongoing economic concerns."

        "summary": "Revenues from tariffs in the US reached $23 billion in May, marking a significant increase of 168% in just three months, as outlined in \"Revenues from Tariffs Spiked to $23 Billion in May, up by 168% in 3 Months.\" This surge highlights the notable impact of tariffs on government revenue, although it only slightly alleviates the substantial US deficit, which requires broader fiscal policy measures, as discussed by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET. \"In May\" details that customs and excise tax collections grew by $6.5 billion compared to April, nearly tripling the average monthly figure from 2024 to reach $24 billion. At this pace, annual customs and excise taxes could potentially add $190 billion in revenues, though the significant US deficit would persist. \"Corporate profits\" have shown considerable growth from 2019 to 2024, particularly among major importing nonfinancial companies. Despite having the capacity to absorb more tariffs, these companies face challenges passing additional costs to consumers who are increasingly resistant to price hikes. Previously, consumer willingness to pay higher prices elevated corporate profits, but current sentiment has led to price reductions for some goods. In response to tariffs, many large companies are opting to relocate production to the US, a strategy that supports the domestic economy through increased investment, employment, and tax revenues, as mentioned in \"To counteract tariff costs.\" While these efforts begin to address import-related trade deficits, substantial progress remains to be made."

        "summary": "The article by Wolf Richter on Wolf Street delves into the mixed signals from various Manufacturing PMIs for North America, highlighting conflicting economic interpretations. In the section \"S&P\u2019s US Manufacturing PMI Shows 'Solid' Growth Powered by Jump in Domestic New Orders,\" the S&P US Manufacturing PMI indicates robust growth due to a surge in domestic new orders, contrasting with the ISM Manufacturing PMI, which shows a contraction caused by declining new orders. This discrepancy adds confusion to processing \"soft data\" like survey-based indicators. The ISM index remains in contraction with shrinking orders and rising input prices, whereas the S&P index signals moderate growth, fueled by domestic demand and a slight uptick in international orders. \"Canada manufacturing in 'steep' contraction\" describes Canada's manufacturing sector as in a \"steep\" contraction with the S&P Canada Manufacturing PMI at 46.1 for May, marking a fourth month below 50, indicating continued declines in production and new orders. International demand is weak, particularly in the US, contributing to job losses at the fastest rate since June 2020. The outlook remains pessimistic due to trade concerns. Meanwhile, \"Mexico manufacturing sees 'solid decline'\" reports a notable decline in Mexico's manufacturing sector, shown by the S&P Manufacturing PMI reading of 46.7. New orders have been shrinking for 11 months, affected by US tariffs and subdued market conditions, with production falling due to supply constraints. Employment trends downward but job cuts are slowing, while input prices rise less steeply. Despite slight improvements, business confidence is low due to economic uncertainties. The broader implication is that while the US enjoys growth from increased domestic orders, Canada and Mexico face challenges, affected by trade uncertainties and supply issues."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter delves into the significant rise in delinquency rates for office commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) in the U.S., which have surged to 10.6%, mirroring the levels at the height of the financial crisis meltdown. This spike is attributed to a trend termed \"flight to quality,\" where businesses are moving towards newer and higher-quality office spaces, leaving older office buildings struggling to maintain occupancy and secure new tenants. This situation reflects ongoing challenges in the commercial real estate (CRE) market, particularly since 2023, characterized by high vacancy rates and landlords unable to meet financial commitments due to insufficient rental income. Extend-and-pretend tactics have deferred defaults but without improvements in interest rates or demand, issues have lingered into 2025. Vacancy rates have reached record highs of over 22% nationwide, with hard-hit markets like San Francisco seeing even larger rates. Office property values have plummeted significantly, with sales occurring at 60% to 70% discounts from pre-pandemic values, but as market conditions stabilize, sales are increasing. The financial risks associated with office CRE loans are spread worldwide across various investors and funds, including public and private REITs and bond funds, rather than being concentrated in banks. While banks have managed some impairments, systemic risk has not been a major issue, though future challenges may arise, particularly for smaller banks. Some buildings are being converted into residential spaces, but these conversions only address a small percentage of the vacant office space. The article underscores the transformative period for the office sector and the complexities surrounding the CRE market, particularly the dispersion of financial risk and high vacancy rates."

        "summary": "In the article \"How Financial Services, a Market Plunge in April, and a Historic Cliff-Dive by Recreation Services Messed with PCE Inflation Today. But a Snap-Back Cometh\" by Wolf Richter on Wolf Street, the discussion centers on how the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation data for April 2025 seemed skewed due to significant declines in financial and recreation services. The section by Wolf Richter, starting with \"In April, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation data appeared skewed,\" talks about the effect of these declines, which temporarily lowered overall inflation indices, creating a misleading impression of benign inflation trends. The article suggests that these trends are not indicative of sustained low inflation, as a rebound in both sectors is expected, likely leading to increased inflationary pressures. The section \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET\" elaborates on how the PCE price index, initially seen as benign and nearing the Federal Reserve\u2019s target, was skewed by these unusual declines. It also likens the financial services' plunge, influenced by a stock market upheaval, to past market disturbances, such as the 2020 crash. Citing Fed Chair Jerome Powell, the article acknowledges that the financial services PCE price index, notable for imputed prices, is subject to quick recovery, thus impacting future inflation metrics. Additionally, the recreation services index's unprecedented dip is expected to be short-lived, affecting adjustments in PCE metrics. Meanwhile, the more stable market-based PCE price index shows persistent inflation pressures, reinforcing expectations of a broader PCE index rebound. The Fed remains alert to these potential adjustments, highlighting the inflation landscape's dynamic nature."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter examines the U.S. government's fiscal challenges through three crucial aspects: Interest Payments to Tax Receipts, the Average Interest Rate on the Debt, and the Debt-to-GDP Ratio in Q1 2025. The article expresses concern over rising interest payments which, due to increasing interest rates and soaring debt levels, are taking up a significant portion of tax revenues. In the first quarter, interest expenses amounted to about $279 billion and represented 34.8% of tax receipts, with a temporary reduction attributed to lower short-term rates and the influence of the debt ceiling impasse. Although this ratio has seen moderation, the debt has expanded by $13 trillion in five years, and with interest rates remain significantly higher than the near-zero rates of 2020 and 2021, government interest costs have continued to climb. The projected Debt-to-GDP ratio for Q1 2025 reduced slightly to 120.8% due to a temporary restriction in debt growth, but the article warns that the US might resort to printing more money\u2014risking runaway inflation\u2014instead of more sustainable deficit reduction measures. Overall, the article underscores the urgency of prudent fiscal management to mitigate these fiscal challenges and enhance financial stability."

The reported 6.3% drop in national pending home sales indicates a future slowdown in closed sales, with the Southern and Western regions, such as California, Texas, and Florida, witnessing substantial inventory growth, reaching five-year highs. The \"In the West: collapsed sales, ballooning inventories\" section highlights California's inventory surge by 51%, indicative of market adjustments to previously high prices. Similarly, \"In the South: collapsed sales, ballooning inventories\" and the focus on Florida and Texas emphasize inventory increases of 35% and 29% respectively, poised to moderate prices. The Northeast and Midwest hadn't fared better, as noted in \"Pending sales in the Northeast and Midwest,\" with significant declines in sales, albeit with some improvement in the Midwest compared to April 2020. The consistent mortgage rate rise since September 2022, discussed in \"Mortgage rates are back in the normal-ish range,\" to 6.89% reflects a return to pre-quantitative easing norms.

These alterations are mainly due to the ECB's quantitative tightening (QT) strategy and updates in gold valuation. The ECB has reduced its balance sheet by shedding \u20ac3.1 trillion in quantitative easing (QE) assets, including bonds and loans, as detailed in the \"Bond and Loan QT progresses: -\u20ac3.09 trillion\" section. These QT measures involved reducing bank loans drastically and allowing bonds to mature without replacements, resulting in a significant lean-down of its financial resources. In tandem, the ECB has marked its gold assets to reflect the current market prices, resulting in a \u20ac409 billion increase or 68% rise, bringing the total to \u20ac1 trillion from a prior \u20ac593 billion as highlighted in sections discussing their mark-to-market adjustments. This gold revaluation is purely on paper and comes amidst global quantitative tightening efforts, setting the ECB apart by its more advanced stance compared to other central banks like the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan. These changes indicate the ECB's strategy to adjust its asset base amidst shifting market conditions, leading to a net decrements in its balance sheet of \u20ac2.54 trillion after factoring in the gold increase which partially offset the QT asset reduction."

While new U.S. durable goods orders saw a 6.3% decline in April following a substantial 7.6% increase in March driven by volatile Boeing aircraft orders, a more positive narrative emerges when examining the three-month average. This average smooths out the volatility caused by the fluctuations in aircraft orders, often affected by significant swings like the $14 billion in orders in February, $37 billion in March, and $18 billion in April, resulting in a notable 0.6% increase in April. Moreover, excluding defense and nondefense aircraft, the three-month average orders also climbed by 0.3% to a record $263 billion, underscoring strong demand for other durable goods. The article further highlights that order backlogs remain at a historic high of $1.41 trillion in March, with a substantial $596 billion attributed to nondefense aircraft, and the backlog excluding aircraft and parts reaching $813 billion, a remarkable 35% rise from early 2020 figures. These insights reflect sustained demand and potential growth in the manufacturing sector, hinting at economic resilience despite the pandemic-related production disruptions. Overall, despite negative headlines, the underlying data indicate a robust and healthy trajectory for durable goods."

The \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET\" section reveals that, although the median price of single-family homes in the U.S. increased slightly year-over-year in April, significant declines were observed in cities such as Austin, Oakland, and San Francisco. This section explains that while some cities continue to see price hikes, others face substantial declines, drawing on data from the Zillow Home Value Index, which uses seasonally adjusted figures to provide a city-level perspective. Lastly, in the section \"The 10 Big Cities with the biggest price declines,\" Richter attributes dramatic drops, such as Austin's 21.5% decrease, Oakland's 19.2% decline, and New Orleans' 16.7% fall, to the Federal Reserve's previous monetary policies, including interest rate manipulations and mortgage securities purchases. As the Fed reverses its policies and mortgage rates rise, these cities experience a correction, indicating a recalibration after significant real estate inflation in recent years."

The article emphasizes challenges posed by these rising yields for economic planning and potential concerns for Congress. Despite the Federal Reserve's 100 basis point reduction in policy rates since mid-September 2024, longer-term yields have increased by 110 basis points, showcasing a divergence referred to as a \"bond bloodbath\" in financial media. The \"No rate cut for months: 6-month Treasury yield\" section highlights the alignment of the six-month Treasury yield with the Effective Federal Funds Rate, indicating rate cuts are unlikely in the near future. In \"Yield curve steepened at long end, sag in the middle flattened,\" changes in the yield curve reflect a reversion from inversion, affected by recent Treasury yield increases. Meanwhile, the \"Mortgage rates again above 7%\" section notes the rise of mortgage rates beyond 7%, following the Federal Reserve's reversal of its Quantitative Easing policy due to rising consumer-price inflation in 2021, which previously drove mortgage rates to historic lows. Lastly, in \"Sleeping through the first innings of anathema,\" the article discusses investor reluctance to buy amid fears of inflation, fiscal concerns, and a lenient Fed, which echoes a troubling fiscal environment from the late 1970s to early 1990s, yet underscores a lack of impetus in the bond market to force governmental action on deficit trimming."

The section \"Homebuilders have been able to maintain sales volumes\" explains how tactics such as mortgage-rate buydowns, incentives, and price reductions have sustained new home sales, particularly strong in the South and West of the US. In \"Inventories for sale are sky-high, especially in the South and West,\" the article details a slight decrease from March's 500,000 to April's inventory of 497,000 single-family homes, still the highest since November 2007. The inventory increase is notable when compared to 2019, with builders eager to sell quickly to free up capital. \"Inventory for sale by region\" highlights the South's inventory rise to 300,000, led by Texas and Florida, handling 60% of US inventory. The West's rise to 115,000 mirrors levels from March 2006, while the Midwest and Northeast saw notable increases as well. \"Sales in the US overall are decent\" notes new house sales performance in March was revised to 63,000, with April recording 68,000 sales, a significant rise from 2019.

This contrasts with the downturn in the market for existing homes. Homebuilders are combating high inventories and challenging market conditions by adopting aggressive sales tactics, such as lowering prices, offering mortgage-rate buydowns, and other incentives to attract buyers, particularly highlighted by Wolf Richter. For instance, Lennar's substantial expenditure on incentives, costing an average of $60,000 per house sold in Q1, underscores these efforts. Despite such incentives, the median contract price of new homes has dropped 2% year-over-year to $407,200 as of April, indicating an 11.5% decline from the October 2022 peak. Notably, inventories of single-family homes in the South and West, as detailed in the \"Inventories for sale are sky-high, especially in the South and West\" section, hit their highest levels since 2007, with the South alone accounting for 60% of the nation's inventory, driven by Texas and Florida. In the \"Inventory for sale by region\" section, sales in the South went up by 5% year-over-year, while the overall new home sales in the US showed a 4.6% increase in April compared to the previous year, despite adjustments as highlighted in \"Sales in the US overall are decent.\" Lastly, \"The homebuilders.\" explains that homebuilders face certain challenges in maintaining sales levels by employing strategies like lower prices and incentives, in contrast to stagnant existing home sales. While these strategies help sustain sales, large homebuilders like DR Horton, Lennar, KB Home, and PulteGroup have seen their stock values drop significantly, by 34% to 44%, since their peaks in September.

Despite spring being a peak time for real estate, this season has seen a significant drop in home sales, marking the weakest April since 2009, due to a previous 50% surge in home prices over three years leading to decreased demand, as detailed in the \"Sales of Existing Single-family Homes, Townhouses, Condos, and Co-ops\" section. This downturn began in early 2022 and is compounded by mortgage rates rising to around 7%, shifting the focus from low inventories to sales declines. The \"Highest Supply for April since 2016\" section notes that home inventory has spiked by 9.0% from March and 20.8% from the previous year, totaling 1.45 million listings, driven by decreased home buying, especially in markets like Florida and California. The \"Demand Destruction by Region\" section explains the regional impacts, with the West seeing its worst April on record while the South and Midwest also experience significant declines in sales, and the Northeast facing similar downturns since the 1990s. \"Mortgage Rates are in the Historically Normal-ish Range\" focuses on the current average 30-year fixed mortgage rate of 6.86%, considered normal historically, yet causing sales declines due to previous artificially low rates that led to unsustainable home prices. Finally, the \"Median Price for Single-family Homes and Condos\" section indicates that median prices reflect slow growth, with single-family homes up 1.7% to $418,000 and condos up 1.4% to $370,000, indicating a slow-down in growth trends alongside a mix of price declines and gains across different markets.

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article, authored by Wolf Richter, titled \"As Tech Jobs Plunge in San Francisco & Silicon Valley, Housing Reacts: Condo Prices Drop Back to 2015, Single-Family Home Prices Back to 2018\", discusses the significant downturn in the San Francisco and Silicon Valley tech job market, which has adversely impacted the housing market. In the section \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET,\" it highlights the decline in high-paying tech jobs since mid-2022, contributing to the slowdown in the housing market's rapid growth. The Information sector has seen a 19% decrease, equating to 25,400 job losses since August 2022, while the Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services sector shed 21,600 jobs, a 9.4% decrease. Overall, 47,000 jobs were lost in these sectors, with broader nonfarm employment dropping by 56,000, a 5.9% decline compared to the 16% during the Dotcom Bust. The section \"And so home prices gave up some big gains\" details how San Francisco's condo prices have fallen 14.6% from their May 2022 peak, returning to May 2015 levels, while single-family home prices dropped 15.1%, reverting to 2018 figures. This correction follows a decade-long surge that doubled condo prices from 2012 to 2022 and spiked single-family home prices by 160%, contributing to a \"housing crisis\" and prompting some employers to relocate to more affordable areas. The decrease in home prices may alleviate the economic strains caused by the prior inflation in housing costs."

        "summary": "The article \"Our Drunken Sailors & their Credit Cards\" by Wolf Richter on Wolf Street examines consumer financial behavior in Q1 2025, focusing on credit card delinquencies, balances, debt-to-income ratios, and credit limits. In the Credit Card Delinquencies section, it is noted that the delinquency rate on credit cards issued by commercial banks dropped to 3.05%, due to previous pandemic financial supports and a subsequent decline after an initial surge. Prime-rated consumers maintained a steady delinquency rate of 1.07%, reflecting financial stability. In the Credit Card Balances section, balances decreased by $29 billion to $1.18 trillion as part of a typical seasonal decline but rose 6.7% year-over-year due to increased spending. The section on The Burden of Credit-Card Balances details a $41 billion (2.3%) quarter-over-quarter drop in consumer debt, but a $66 billion (4.0%) year-over-year rise, aligning with disposable income growth. The debt-to-income ratio declined to 7.8%, rebounding from pandemic lows. Lastly, the Credit Limits & Available Credit section highlights that banks are expanding credit limits to $5.16 trillion, with unused credit reaching $4.0 trillion, contrasting with post-Great Recession cuts. Overall, the article suggests a cautious consumer market adapting to post-pandemic financial realities, with restrained spending and prudent credit use."

        "summary": "Japan's bond market is facing turbulences mainly due to the pressures emerging from the Bank of Japan's quantitative tightening policy amid higher inflation rates than the US and a weakened yen, as detailed in \"Japan\u2019s 30-Year and 40-Year Bonds Crater, Yields Spike, Huge Mess Coming Home to Roost. Yen Carry Trade at Risk.\" In \"Wolf Richter for Wolf Street,\" it is noted that the yields on Japan's 30-year and 40-year government bonds have risen significantly, with the 40-year bond yield reaching 3.56%, which remains below the nation's inflation rate, resulting in a negative real yield. Investors who bought these bonds at lower yields are facing potential losses unless the bonds are held to maturity, where they will still suffer diminished real value due to inflation. Despite Japan's A1 credit rating from Moody\u2019s, its financial situation is perceived worse than Greece when considering its debt-to-GDP ratio, though it holds substantial foreign reserves. The weak yen complicates the market, making Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields less attractive compared to the higher yields in the US. The Bank of Japan's significant reduction in JGB holdings is influencing market behavior as investors evaluate the security and attractiveness of these bonds. In \"The 10-year JGB yields have increased modestly to 1.53%, still presenting a negative real yield but an improvement from past negative rates,\" the Bank of Japan's strategic shift away from its historical bond accumulation patterns is highlighted, with a notable decrease in holdings triggering cyclic adjustments by institutional investors due to maturing long-term bonds and the issuance of new bonds."

        "summary": "In the Wolf Street article \u201cThe Most Splendid Housing Bubbles in America, April 2025: The Price Drops & Gains in 33 of the Largest Housing Markets,\u201d author Wolf Richter analyzes the cooling trend in the U.S. housing market, examining the dynamics of various Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs). During the typically robust spring selling season, home prices showed uncharacteristically modest increases, with April's national month-over-month rise at only 0.65%. The \"growing list of Down Year-over-Year\" section highlights 18 MSAs experiencing year-over-year price declines, with Austin, Tampa, and San Antonio showing the largest drops, indicating a nationwide softening in real estate values. \"Down from the 2022 peaks\" describes significant price reductions in 19 out of 33 metros since the 2022 peaks, with Austin and Phoenix leading these declines according to Zillow's Home Value Index. The \"The 33 Most Splendid Housing Bubbles\" section explores the fluctuations in home prices across 33 significant MSAs, emphasizing substantial price drops from their 2022 heights, notably in Austin and San Francisco. Despite these declines, areas like Salt Lake City and Seattle have seen some yearly growth, although it is waning. In \"The 14 markets are higher than in mid-2022,\" the article compares home price changes to past years, with cities like Miami and San Diego facing negative year-over-year declines, while places such as Los Angeles and Boston still experience shrinking yearly gains amidst enduring growth. Overall, the article reveals a widespread and complex shift in housing markets across various regions, underscoring the recent slowdown in growth amidst long-term increases since 2000."

        "summary": "The article titled \"Foreign Investors Loaded Up on Treasury Securities in March Despite all the Turmoil in the Media\" by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street discusses the significant increase in foreign investment in U.S. Treasury securities amidst global uncertainties. In March, foreign investors notably expanded their holdings by $233 billion compared to February, reaching a record $9.05 trillion, with $133 billion directed towards long-term Treasury securities. While major holders increased their investments, exceptions were observed with China, Hong Kong, and Ireland. Notably, Canada's holdings soared despite tariffs and negative sentiment towards the U.S. Despite the rise in foreign holdings, domestic investors have had to fill the gap left by the faster-growing U.S. debt, with foreign ownership climbing to 25% in March 2025. In the section \"Auction purchases by foreign investors through April,\" foreign investors bought $36 billion in Treasury notes and bonds, covering 9.7% of total sales. However, these purchases have not kept pace with auction sizes needed for the rising budget deficits, pressing domestic investors to cover shortages, potentially requiring higher yields. Under \"Euro Area v. China + Hong Kong,\" the article notes that China and Hong Kong reduced holdings by $30 billion in March, but overall increased by $53 billion over the year. In contrast, the Euro Area raised its holdings significantly, led by financial centers like Luxembourg and Belgium, reaching $1.86 trillion. Japan, financial centers, and Canada also saw increases, with Canada's quadrupling since 2021. Other increases were noted in France, India, Brazil, and Taiwan, reflecting shifts in global investment strategies and the pivotal roles of financial centers in managing these assets."

        "summary": "Moody's recent downgrade of the US government's credit rating from a triple-A to Aa1 has caused concern over the nation's mounting deficits and debt. The article, titled \"Moody\u2019s Cuts US Government Credit Rating due to Deficits & Debt, Blames \u2018Successive US Administrations and Congress\u2019,\" highlights that this decision reflects ongoing fiscal mismanagement by successive US administrations and Congress, leading to doubts about their ability to manage finances effectively. According to Wolf Richter for Wolf Street, Moody's pointed to the failure to address large fiscal deficits and rising interest costs, projecting the federal deficit to balloon to nearly 9% of GDP by 2035. Moody's downgrade follows similar actions by S&P Global Ratings in 2011 and Fitch Ratings in 2023, leaving it as the last of the major credit agencies to lower the US rating. Despite historical precedents where such downgrades did not trigger significant upheaval, concerns remain about potential inflation and bond market reactions, particularly if central bank interventions stir uncontrolled inflation akin to scenarios in other countries. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield experienced only a slight increase, suggesting minimal immediate market panic. However, substantial deficit reduction efforts are anticipated only if bond market conditions severely pressure Congress and the Administration to act."

        "summary": "In the article \"Serious Delinquencies for Subprime & Prime in Q1 2025: Our Drunken Sailors and their Auto Loans\" by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street, it is revealed that in Q1 2025, a rare decline in auto loan balances occurred despite surging vehicle sales, suggesting consumers are increasingly opting to pay cash, likely to avoid high-interest rates. This trend, discussed in \"Auto-Loan Balances,\" is highlighted by a $13 billion drop in loan and lease balances, equivalent to 0.8%, according to the New York Fed, with 63.5% of used vehicle buyers paying in cash compared to 58.4% two years prior. In \"The burden of auto loans and leases,\" the article explores how a combination of a decline in auto loan balances and a rise in disposable income improved households' debt-to-income ratio to 7.4%, signifying consumers' enhanced capacity to handle auto debts despite a year-over-year increase in auto debt. The section \"Serious delinquency rates: total, subprime, and prime\" notes that while the 60-plus day delinquency rate for all loans slightly decreased to 1.51% in March from earlier months, it remained higher than the previous year. Specifically, the subprime delinquency rate rose by 45 basis points to 6.07% in March. These high-risk loans, primarily for used vehicles through specialized dealer-lender chains, face challenges post-pandemic, with companies like America's Car-Mart experiencing stock value declines. Meanwhile, prime auto loans maintain stability with low delinquency rates at 0.36%. The article concludes that while the auto loan market remains robust, challenges persist in subprime segments, but the general consumer base is managing loans effectively, humorously likening them to \"Drunken Sailors\" in this broader financial landscape."

Despite these falls, some metropolitan areas, like Montreal and Quebec City, reached all-time high prices, reflecting a mixed market landscape. This downturn was examined by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street, who noted in his section that demand in the Canadian housing market was plummeting, as evidenced by a 9.8% drop in home sales compared to the previous year and a national price index decline. Single-family home prices fell by 3.1% year-over-year, while Toronto's market hit marked lows, contrasting with Montreal and Quebec City's highs. Similarly, condo prices reached lows last seen in August 2021, dropping 4.4% from the previous year. The section titled \"Prices in the major Canadian markets\" elaborates on these region-specific trends, highlighting a 21.1% drop in Toronto's home prices from their peak, contrasting with Montreal's 9.2% year-over-year increase. Other regions like Vancouver, Calgary, Victoria, and Ottawa also experienced varying changes, indicating localized factors in play and underlining the Canadian real estate market's diversity amidst these downturns and growths."

Despite reported economic pessimism, factors such as low unemployment and rising wages are driving consumer spending, highlighting a gap between perception and reality. The Census Bureau's revised retail sales data utilizing the NAICS system reveals alterations in representation, excluding sales from non-employer retailers and offering a new angle on retail activity. With adjustments, retail sales still reached record highs in March and April, with significant contributions from the restaurant and bar sectors, despite inflation and negative media narratives. The section \"Retail sales by the largest categories of retailers\" notes a slight dip in sales from vehicle dealers and parts stores from record March highs but an overall 9.4% year-over-year increase. Ecommerce and nonstore retail sectors grew 0.2% monthly and 7.5% annually, making up 17% of total sales, while food services and drinking places rebounded with a 7.8% yearly rise. Categories such as food and beverage stores and general merchandise shops saw modest annual gains, despite minimal changes. Gas station sales, affected by fuel prices, decreased both monthly and annually, whereas building materials and health and personal care sectors experienced moderate growth. Clothing stores had a slight monthly decline but managed a 3.5% year-over-year increase. Overall, the article explores the complex dynamics of consumer sentiment and spending, illustrating broader economic impacts and potential future retail trends."

The \"Here come the HELOCs: +27% in three years\" section notes a significant 27% increase in HELOC balances over three years to $402 billion, highlighting their appeal due to flexible cash access without refinancing. However, HELOCs pose risks through second liens and potential rising interest rates. In \"The burden of housing debt: Housing-debt-to-Income Ratio,\" it is noted that while housing debt has increased, the housing-debt-to-income ratio is stable at 59.4%, thanks to rising disposable income. The \"Who is on the hook this time?\" section details banks' limited mortgage exposure compared to their substantial role in HELOCs, while exposing that taxpayer-backed institutions like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac now bear most mortgage risk. Meanwhile, \"So far, so good\" indicates that although serious mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures are rising, they remain below pre-pandemic levels. Market dynamics influenced by surging home prices during the pandemic have allowed many homeowners to avoid foreclosure by selling homes profitably, as discussed in various sections throughout the article. Overall, the article underscores current trends, roles of stakeholders, and potential risks in the housing market amid economic changes."

In the \"Household Debts\" section, it reports that US total household debt rose by $167 billion to $18.2 trillion in Q1 2025, with an annual growth rate of 2.9%, the smallest since Q1 2021. Despite increased mortgage, HELOC, and student loan balances, certain categories like auto loans and credit cards saw decreases. The \"Debt-to-Income Ratio\" section explains that the US household debt-to-income ratio fell to 81.9% in Q1, the lowest since 2003, as disposable income growth outpaced debt growth. While consumers have improved their balance sheets and spending remains stable, subprime borrowers and heavily leveraged entities like the federal government face challenges. The \"Serious Delinquencies\" section observes that student loans are delinquent again, with a sharp rise in the serious delinquency rate to 7.7%, and overall consumer delinquency rates increased to 2.8% in Q1, but remain below pre-pandemic levels. The \"Collections\" section notes a decrease in third-party collections to a new low of 4.56% in Q1, reflecting ongoing sales of delinquent loans to collection agencies. The restructuring of loan forgiveness programs contributes to intricacies in debt management strategies. In the \"Foreclosures\" section, the rising foreclosure rate remains below 2018-2019 levels, aided by higher pandemic-era home prices allowing profitable sales before foreclosure. Finally, the \"Bankruptcies\" section highlights a \"broken frying-pan pattern\" in bankruptcy filings, which have decreased to their lowest post-pandemic levels due to government stimulus measures. The article foreshadows future segments on housing, credit card, and auto debt, shedding light on evolving debt trends."

Notably, in the \"Beneath the Skin of CPI Inflation\" section, services such as rent, medical care, and motor vehicle-related services surged, while apparel and footwear prices saw declines. The \"Core services\" CPI marked a 0.29% rise month-to-month, showing persistent inflationary pressures despite a slight deceleration in the six-month rate. The \"Housing components of core services\" section detailed significant increases in Owners' Equivalent Rent (OER) and Rent of Primary Residence, which rose by 4.3% and 4.0% year-over-year respectively, contributing robustly to CPI growth alongside a sharp uptick in motor vehicle maintenance and repair costs. In the \"Prices of Goods\" section, used vehicle prices rose for the seventh successive month, while new vehicle prices showed marginal monthly alterations and minor year-over-year increases. The \"Energy\" section reported a complex picture, with gasoline prices showing month-to-month stability post-adjustment, yet plummeting by 11.8% year-over-year due to oil price drops. Meanwhile, despite some stability over two years, the overall energy CPI grew slightly due to increased utility costs, including a notable 15.7% rise in natural gas prices year-over-year. The data reflects how durable goods prices continue to decrease, while earlier fears of tariff-related consumer price increases remain unfounded."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter discusses job losses in the nonbank mortgage lending sector, reflected in the section titled \"Housing Bubble & Bust #1 and #2 as Seen through Employment at Mortgage Lenders: They Shed Jobs Again, 38% Gone.\" Nonbank mortgage lenders and brokers, which rapidly adjust their workforce to service demand changes, have shed 38% of jobs due to the collapse in demand, highlighting the industry's cyclical nature. The decline in employment stems from a housing market bust, characterized by the lowest home sales since the mid-1990s and a peak in 2021. The downturn saw home sales drop by 24% in 2024 compared to 2019 and 34% compared to 2021, attributed to inflated home prices deterring buyers and reducing mortgage originations. Consequently, mortgage applications plummeted, with purchase applications down 40% from 2019 levels and refinancing plummeting 78% from 2021, severely impacting the lending industry. The article underscores the significant role of lenders like United Wholesale Mortgage and Rocket Mortgage, which accounted for a majority of mortgages in 2024. Despite some recovery among mortgage brokers in 2025, employment remains down by 35% from 2021, contrasting with nonbank lenders. Overall, the downturn in applications and home sales led to substantial job losses, especially in the refinance segment, as lenders adapt to declining demand and recalibrate after past market excesses."

        "summary": "The article by Wolf Richter on Wolf Street discusses the complexities of the debt ceiling and its impact on financial markets, detailing how it temporarily enhances liquidity before withdrawing it rapidly. In the section \"How the Debt Ceiling Is Now Pouring Liquidity into Financial Markets, only to Suck it Back Out Very Fast Later this Year,\" Richter explains that typically, raising the debt ceiling extracted close to $840 billion from overnight reverse repurchase agreements within five months, but given the current state of quantitative tightening, which has already reduced $2.26 trillion from the system, funds in these agreements are almost exhausted. This historical trend underscores possible significant liquidity shifts due to federal fiscal policy changes. The subsequent section by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street details the fluctuations of the Treasury General Account (TGA), noting that its balance increased from $296 billion to $678 billion by the end of April due in part to tax inflows, but decreased to $576 billion by May 8, which pushes the potential out-of-money date to August. Generally, the TGA balance climbs after Congress addresses the debt ceiling, and it is influenced by Treasury debt issuance, tax collections, and government spending. Richter mentions how the U.S. Treasury Department aims for an $800 billion TGA balance to manage cash flow, and in 2023, replenishing it required issuing T-bills financed by money market funds withdrawing from overnight reverse repos. At present, excess liquidity in these repos has dwindled to $142 billion, causing any $800 billion TGA refill to heavily tap into financial market liquidity and banking reserves. Despite a recent tax inflow, strengthened by capital gains taxes and tariffs, which temporarily eased liquidity pressures, a delay in debt ceiling adjustments by Congress could soon stress the financial markets."

        "summary": "In the Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter, the fluctuations in U.S. Treasury yields are discussed, with the 10-year Treasury yield recently reaching 4.39%, leading to a steepening at the long end of the yield curve. Despite market instability and speculative rumors, foreign buyers have continued purchasing U.S. Treasuries, as seen in \"Foreigners kept buying at Treasury auctions, no problem.\" However, the \"swap spread trade\" experienced disruptions, although there was \"No Evidence\" the basis trade blew, according to Roberto Perli from the New York Fed. Meanwhile, \"Mortgage rates remain near 7%,\" with the average 30-year fixed rate maintaining a historically high spread of 2.4 percentage points above the 10-year Treasury yield. In economic strategy, the Fed\u2019s new mantra: \u201cWait and see\u201d reflects Chairman Jerome Powell's cautious stance on rate cuts, with the bond market not anticipating imminent rate reductions. Lastly, the yield curve steepened at the long end, as long-term yields surpassed short-term ones, indicating adjustments in the maturity spectrum amid changes in investor sentiment and the broader economic environment."

        "summary": "The article \"Recession Watch: Time to Dig Out Our Favorite Recession Indicator Again\" by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street delves into the increasing speculation surrounding a potential recession and revisits a trusted recession indicator. While economic indicators present mixed signals, creating uncertainty about impending recession timing and likelihood, various concerns arise from interest rate changes, consumer spending, and employment rates, influencing economic growth and stability. The \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET\" section outlines how the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) defines recessions as broad economic downturns with labor market declines, such as falling employment and rising unemployment. Specifically, weekly unemployment insurance benefits data, particularly continued claims or \"insured unemployment,\" act as early signs of systemic job losses. Historically, significant spikes in insured unemployment have preceded the last three business cycle recessions, with thresholds rising with total employment increases. Presently, around 2.7 million insured unemployment claims may signal a recession's start, but recent figures have decreased to 1.88 million, showcasing market stability. Even with a 2023 claims surge from historically low levels signifying labor market rebalancing, not a recession, layoff levels remain low; hiring, although slowed from 2022, is still at a historically fast absorption rate, indicating balanced labor market demand and supply. While negative GDP growth from high imports may not always indicate recessions due to offsetting strong consumer spending and business investments, unemployment insurance benefits data provides a more immediate recession indicator through timely warnings of sharp job-related figure increases, as GDP data is less immediate."

        "summary": "In the article \"I\u2019ve Been Screaming about Rising Used-Vehicle Prices since Aug 2024 (and No One Paid Attention) but Suddenly It\u2019s the Tariffs?\" by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street, the focus is on the rising prices of used vehicles. An essential aspect highlighted is a constrained inventory due to the reduced availability of 2021 and 2022 model years, stemming from earlier new-vehicle shortages and ongoing supply chain disruptions rather than tariffs. With the Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index reflecting a 6.2% increase in wholesale prices since June 2024, the article emphasizes that tight inventories, due to a lack of vehicle returns and reduced production because of semiconductor shortages from prior years, are driving prices up. This rise is impacting inflation, although media coverage has diverted to tariffs as a cause. In \"W.R.,\" Wolf Richter explains that tax refunds have also fueled demand for used vehicles, boosting sales especially in March, where both retail and wholesale prices saw a dip, possibly because of the high volume of tax refunds acting similarly to stimulus checks. Additionally, sensational media attention regarding tariffs may have inadvertently increased consumer interest and purchases. The article stresses that the main issue is a limited supply amidst strong consumer demand, not tariffs, and highlights the inflationary effects and trends on the core Consumer Price Index (CPI), which had previously gone under the radar until discussions around tariffs emerged."

This decision marks the third consecutive meeting where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has not changed the policy rates, following a previous 100-basis-point reduction in 2024. The FOMC's cautious approach is highlighted in a section named \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET,\" emphasizing fears of persistent inflation and a labor market that may weaken despite current solid business investments and consumer spending. The Fed continues its quantitative tightening (QT) strategy but at a slower pace, sticking to their March announcement, and has seen a significant runoff of assets since 2022. The section \"The whole statement\" outlines that the U.S. economy is growing steadily with stable labor conditions, though inflation remains somewhat high, prompting the Fed to uphold its dual mandate of maximum employment and long-term 2% inflation. Without a new \"Summary of Economic Projections\" (SEP) until June, the Fed's guidance remains cautious, taking into account economic indicators like labor market conditions and inflation expectations, backed collectively by Chair Jerome Powell and other FOMC members to ensure economic stability."

Leasing Jumps amid 35% Vacancy Rates and 21% Drop in Asking Rents,\" explores the significant recovery in San Francisco\u2019s commercial real estate (CRE) market after a dramatic repricing that led to valuation drops of up to 70%. In the section, \"For Wolf Street,\" it highlights a key sale where an older office building at 799 Market Street sold for $44 million, a sharp decline from its 2016 purchase price of $141 million. This sale to Sansome Street Advisors exemplifies a trend of properties being acquired at substantial discounts, attracting investors interested in conversion or redevelopment opportunities. The article emphasizes the persistent glut of office space in San Francisco, with around 36% availability due to diminished demand and dropping rents, and despite active leasing, vacancy rates remain high. The \"Effective Repricing\" section suggests that the repricing has injected liquidity into the market, allowing deals to move forward after a period of stagnation, which starkly contrasts with the national residential market\u2019s slow pace due to inventory issues. San Francisco\u2019s swift market correction provides a strategic framework for other sectors, demonstrating that significant price adjustments can stimulate sales even amidst high vacancy rates and economic uncertainties."

This increase in the Multivariate Core Trend (MCT) is driven by the non-housing services sector and suggests a potential acceleration in the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, coinciding with a crucial Federal Reserve meeting. The second section by Wolf Richter, titled \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET,\" details the onset of the MCT measure in April 2022, which came about after a PCE price index surge. This measure accurately forecasted previous PCE measure decelerations but now indicates possible inflation acceleration, primarily in non-housing services and core goods. By March, the MCT rate reached 3.0%, shifting attention from housing costs to other sectors. With the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) set to discuss these trends, there is an emphasis on countering potential inflation hikes, especially amidst consumer resistance and external pressures for rate cuts. The article underlines the complexities facing the Federal Reserve in navigating inflation dynamics."

According to the section \"The inventory of homes for sale in California has significantly increased year-over-year,\" active listings have surged, most notably in San Diego by 70%, Los Angeles by 50%, San Jose and Silicon Valley by 67%, and the San Francisco metro area by 43%, representing the highest levels seen since at least 2016. In the following section, \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET,\" the text delves deeper into these statistics, highlighting that San Francisco's active listings hit the highest level for April since 2016, and San Jose experienced a 68% increase, surpassing 2019 levels. Meanwhile, Los Angeles County's 50% increase neared 2019 levels and San Diego County's listings more than doubled year-over-year. This influx in listings represents the most substantial increase for any April since 2016, aside from 2019, across California, potentially reviving a stagnant real estate market hampered by decreasing sales volumes. The overall inventory accrual could pave the way for enhanced flexibility and activity within the housing market, breaking previous stasis conditions as unsold inventory builds up."

Some Metros Start Seeing Gluts, Miami Still Lags a Little\" by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street, it is reported that Florida has seen a notable increase in unsold home inventory in April due to the rise in active listings across several metropolitan areas when compared to pre-pandemic levels. Jacksonville experienced a 23% increase, North Port-Sarasota 29%, Tampa 31%, Orlando 40%, and Cape Coral-Fort Myers 42%, with Lakeland-Winter Haven witnessing the highest surge at 71%. In contrast, Miami's market experienced less drastic changes, highlighting regional variations in housing trends within Florida. The increase in inventory is partly due to high mortgage rates driving sellers to list more homes, while buyer demand has decreased because of excessively high housing prices\u2014an issue of demand destruction. Housing prices, which soared dramatically since 2020, have alienated potential buyers, as seen in Tampa where prices spiked 60% over two years. However, markets are beginning to adjust as prices in many Florida metros start to decline, suggesting that eventual price corrections may alleviate the issue of diminished demand. The Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach metro itself saw a 41% increase in April listings, along with significant growth in other metros, marking the highest regional inventory levels since 2016."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article, \"Tariffs Start Washing into the Government Checking Account | Wolf Street,\" by Wolf Richter, examines the impact of newly implemented tariffs on government revenue and domestic production. The section \"Collections from customs and excise taxes surged by 81% in April compared to March\" reports a substantial 81% increase in customs and excise tax collections, totaling $17.4 billion. This rise highlights the financial effect of tariffs, underscoring their role in fiscal policy. \"Companies like GM have faced significant costs due to new tariffs\" discusses how companies such as General Motors are absorbing high tariff costs, estimated between $4 billion to $5 billion, and are shifting production to the US to cope. Despite elevated costs, automakers struggle to pass these onto consumers amid stagnant sales. Corporations previously favored low-tax jurisdictions, but tariffs pressure them towards US-based production, enhancing tax revenue balance. The section titled \"This $17.4 billion in Customs and Excise Taxes was just the initial shot\" details the complexities introduced by Trump's tariffs on \"Liberation Day,\" with negotiations ongoing to optimize outcomes. Initially, shipments under $800 could enter the US tariff-free, boosting imports from China until May. Tariffs aim to boost US manufacturing, historically an essential revenue stream pre-income tax. Notably, several manufacturers, including GM, plan major domestic investments, promising long-term economic gains and enhanced tax receipts. Globally, higher tariffs in countries like India and China highlight their efficacy in strengthening manufacturing sectors. Overall, US manufacturing expansion is portrayed as advantageous for both economic growth and government revenue."

The section \"Labor Market Is Just Fine Despite Dropping Federal Government Jobs\" highlights that despite a decrease of 26,000 federal government jobs over three months, total nonfarm payrolls have seen an increase of 177,000 in April, reaching a record high of 159.5 million. In \"Media-Driven Moaning and Groaning,\" the article notes that the labor market is resilient, absorbing a massive influx of immigrants between 2021 and 2024, which has been reflected in labor force data. This influx is also contributing to the deceleration of wage growth, with average hourly earnings increasing slightly by 0.17% in April, below the 12-month average, yet the year-over-year earnings increase remains higher than pre-pandemic levels at 3.8%. In \"Tariff Chaos,\" despite anticipations of instability, the unemployment rate remains steady at 4.2%, even as 82,000 more individuals joined the workforce, indicating a balanced labor market below the Federal Reserve's projected unemployment rate for 2025. Hence, despite the challenges from tariff issues and negative media narratives, the labor market's resilience is evident in the consistent growth in employment and stable unemployment rates."

        "summary": "In the Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter, the Federal Reserve's quantitative tightening (QT) efforts have led to a $14 billion reduction in its balance sheet in April, totaling a $2.26 trillion decrease from its peak, reducing the balance sheet to $6.71 trillion\u2014the lowest since April 2020. The article highlights that the Fed's QT has significantly shed 46.9% of the $4.81 trillion amassed during the pandemic quantitative easing (QE), with a 25.2% reduction in total assets and an assets-to-GDP ratio now at 22.4%, reminiscent of 2013 levels. In the \"QT assets\" section, it is mentioned that the Fed cut down Treasury securities by $3.2 billion in March and has reduced these holdings by $1.56 trillion since June 2022, a 27% decrease, covering 47.6% of Treasury securities acquired during pandemic QE. Moreover, in April, it reduced mortgage-backed securities (MBS) holdings by $16 billion, marking a total reduction of $567 billion since the peak, largely due to fewer mortgage refinancings and home sales. The \"Bank liquidity facilities: inactive\" section notes that despite the availability of three active bank liquidity facilities following the March 2023 banking crisis, these facilities remain largely inactive, with limited usage such as a slight increase in Discount Window borrowing to $3.5 billion. The \"What else was part of the $14 billion in QT?\" section delves into the breakdown of April\u2019s QT, revealing a $19.2 billion reduction from Treasury and MBS holdings, offset by a $1.3 billion increase from Discount Window borrowing and a $5 billion rise in \"other assets.\" It also explains unamortized premiums, which have decreased from $356 billion in November 2021 to $241 billion, illustrating the Fed's gradual amortization as it manages QE-induced excesses. This comprehensive examination of QT measures indicates a moderate recovery as assets-to-GDP have descended from a pandemic peak of 35.5% to a level slightly above Q3 2013."

This spike, triggered by over $1 billion in newly delinquent debt, underscores financial distress, reflecting widespread economic uncertainties affecting investors and stakeholders linked to these asset classes. Additionally, office mortgage delinquencies within CMBS have remained high since mid-2023, peaking at 11.0% in December 2024, only to re-spike to 10.3% in April 2025. These delinquencies accentuate the difficulties faced by landlords of older buildings amidst a market preference for high-quality modern office spaces, contributing to record U.S. office vacancy rates of 22.6% in early 2025. The article notes that multifamily debt represents a substantial portion (45%) of the $4.8 trillion in overall CRE debt, with $2.2 trillion outstanding by the end of 2024. Delinquencies, resulting from missed interest payments beyond a 30-day grace period, can be resolved through payment, foreclosure, or loan restructuring, although such resolutions often lead to considerable losses for CMBS holders, further reflecting the broader financial challenges within the CRE industry."

In February, revisions led to the 12-month core PCE price index reaching +3.0% and the 6-month index +3.4%, both the highest since July 2023, predominantly driven by substantial adjustments in core services (up from 0.35% to 0.52%). This section, \"Sharp Up-Revisions of Prior Month's Inflation,\" emphasizes the major role core services played in these upward adjustments and outlines that the year-over-year core PCE figures were also revised upwards, with the overall PCE rising from 2.5% to 2.7% and core services moving from 3.6% to 3.8%, indicating a significant escalation. In March, as detailed in the section \"In March, the price changes were from the up-revised February levels,\" although the overall yearly PCE index increased by 2.3%, it fell short of the Fed's 2.0% target partially due to decreased energy costs; durable goods prices fell by 1.0% while monthly overall PCE decreased by 0.04% largely because of energy price drops. The core PCE index excluding food and energy slightly decelerated to 0.03% from February's revised high, with the 6-month core PCE indexing at an annualized growth of 3.0%. Housing inflation surged 0.39% in March, marking the sharpest rise since August 2024, while food and beverage prices climbed 0.46% as the energy index dropped 2.7%, underlining energy volatility's impact on inflation trends. Despite tariffs, durable goods prices remained stable, with pandemic-induced inflation as a key driver."

The \"GDP Whacked by Massive Spike in Imports on Frontrunning of Tariffs\" section highlights that government spending also reduced GDP growth by an additional 0.25 percentage points. Under \"Consumer Spending Grew,\" it notes a modest export growth contrasted by a 41.3% surge in imports, negatively affecting GDP; however, this is viewed more as a reaction to recovering supply chains rather than weakened demand. Within the \"Business Investment Soared\" section, private domestic demand showed resilience with a 3.0% annualized growth rate, consumer spending increased by 1.8% in Q1, and private fixed investment jumped by 7.8%, largely due to robust equipment investments. Meanwhile, decreased government consumption and investment added to the GDP's decline, though there was a slight improvement in the Debt-to-GDP ratio, suggesting underlying economic strength amid trade challenges."

        "summary": "The article \"Despite All Moaning and Groaning: Layoffs & Discharges Plunge, Hires and Voluntary Quits Rise, Driven by Private Sector Strength\" by Wolf Richter on Wolf Street discusses the strong improvement in the labor market starting in the fall of 2024, persisting into March 2025. According to the March section of the article, layoffs and discharges dropped by 222,000 to 1.56 million, the lowest since November 2023, and are significantly below pre-pandemic levels despite layoffs in government roles. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) attributes these separations to firings or layoffs for economic reasons. Quits rose sharply by 82,000 to 3.33 million, indicating strong worker confidence in seeking new opportunities, a trend evident even with reduced government position quits. This reflects a shift towards pre-pandemic turnover levels, although quits haven't fully returned to pre-COVID-19 levels due to employer strategies since 2022 to minimize workforce instability. The March section also highlights a spike in hires to 5.41 million, the highest since September 2004, demonstrating positive labor market momentum. There was a reduction in job openings by 288,000 to 7.19 million, with the slowed churn due to reduced layoffs and quits reducing immediate vacancies. The labor market recovery momentum began in late 2024, resulting in a stronger and more stable market by 2025."

        "summary": "The article from Wolf Street, authored by Wolf Richter, titled \"How Gold Imports Blew up Atlanta Fed GDPNow: The Old Model is Dead, Long Live the 'New GDPNow Model' Starting Apr 30,\" discusses the volatility of the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model due to an unforeseen surge in gold imports. This event led to an unexpected dramatic revision in GDP growth estimates, highlighting the model's sensitivity to unusual economic anomalies that do not accurately reflect the broader economic health. As described in the section \"The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) to release first GDP estimate for Q1, while GDPNow projected growth above 2% but was later adjusted to nearly -3% due to gold imports causing a viral panic about an economic downturn,\" the model initially predicted a growth above 2% for Q1, which adjusted to nearly -3% following a spike in gold imports, causing a false alarm over the economic downturn. The gold imports skewed the model due to their unusual role in GDP calculations, being improperly classified. As a remedy, the \"Gold adjusted GDPNow\" indicator was introduced, providing a more conservative projection. The section titled \u201c'Why the disparity in these measures of gold imports?'\u201d explains that the discrepancy arises from the BEA reclassifying certain imports as gold, mainly gold bars, which surged from $2.08 billion in November 2024 to $28.69 billion in January 2025, later dropping slightly to $22.96 billion in February 2025. These imports, part of the industrial supplies aggregate in the AEI report, pose challenges for forecasting models lacking disaggregated data, leaving analysts relying on international trade data, like Swiss gold exports to the U.S., which have markedly increased for market suitability purposes. Due to these complications in reflecting accurate economic conditions, the article suggests discarding industrial supplies trade data in forecasts unless more detailed information is provided, in order to improve the reliability of economic forecasting models, a step being taken with the new model launching April 30. The article concludes with Wolf Street's mention of their reliance on reader support."

        "summary": "The article \"10-Year Treasury Yield Re-Dips Below EFFR, Yield Curve Sags Deeply in the Middle, Dollar Bounces Back into 3-Year Range\" on Wolf Street by Wolf Richter explores the complexities of the current U.S. Treasury yield curve, highlighting that the 10-year Treasury yield has dipped below the Effective Federal Funds Rate (EFFR) at 4.29%, reflecting bond market volatility amidst ongoing tensions. According to the section \"Foreigners kept buying Treasuries just fine,\" foreign investors continue to show strong interest in U.S. Treasury securities, purchasing a significant portion of 10-year and 30-year bonds, which keeps yields low despite perceived risks and aligns with historical averages. In \"The yield curve\u2019s sag in the middle deepens,\" the yield curve has notably sagged in the mid-maturities, with a decline in 1- to 7-year yields, while the 30-year yield rises, showing a realignment post-Fed rate adjustments. In \"Bessent\u2019s yield bash-down,\" Treasury Secretary Bessent's efforts to lower the 10-year yield temporarily reduced it below 4%, which impacted demand, but it later rose again to about 4.3%. This reflects the intrinsic pull of Treasury securities based on their yield attractiveness. Lastly, in \"Bessent\u2019s dollar bash-down,\" Bessent's attempts to weaken the U.S. dollar to enhance export competitiveness saw limited success, with the dollar index (DXY) remaining robust within the 100 range compared to past values. Despite fiscal strategies to reduce the dollar's strength, it remains resilient, endorsing confidence in U.S. economic policies."

        "summary": "The article titled \"Office Vacancy Rate in the US Worsens to Record 22.6% in Q1 amid Federal Government Lease Terminations\" by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street outlines the record-high office vacancy rate in the US, which reached 22.6% in the first quarter due to factors including the federal government's lease terminations. This development, highlighted in the section authorship, has implications for commercial real estate (CRE) delinquency rates, though the impact may be delayed due to the bureaucratic nature and long timelines of government lease terminations. Importantly, federal buildings are usually in prime locations, and their impact will depend on the private sector's capacity to absorb or repurpose these spaces. The \"For\" section of the article reveals that in Q1, the US added 8.06 million square feet of vacant office space, resulting in 1.1 billion square feet overall and a vacancy rate of 22.6%. Federal lease terminations by the government and contractors, totaling 7.56 million square feet across 653 leases, were major contributors, although many were rescinded amid operational chaos. Office inventory declined by over 11 million square feet to 4.8 billion square feet due to conversions, redevelopments, and decreased office space deliveries. Groundbreaking for new construction also slowed to under 1 million square feet. S&P Global Ratings projected significant government lease terminations by 2028 as leases expire or through termination options. The end-of-Q1 delinquency rate for office mortgages in commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) slightly fell to 9.8% from a spike to 11.0% in December. This rate has yet to reflect recent lease terminations, suggesting that ongoing monitoring is crucial to assess the full impact."

        "summary": "In the Wolf Street article \"Sales of Existing Homes Drop to Worst March since 2009. West, South, Midwest, Northeast All Get Crushed. Supply Surges to Highest since 2016,\" the housing market is depicted as enduring a challenging phase, marked by the worst March performance since 2009. This downturn is attributed to surging property prices over the past three years, which along with mortgage rates that have stabilized above 6%, deter potential homebuyers, leading to demand destruction across all regions, namely West, South, Midwest, and Northeast. As highlighted in the section titled \"Highest supply for March since 2016,\" the housing inventory has increased substantially to 1.33 million listings, the highest level for March since 2016, as supply of unsold homes rises to match diminished demand. In \"Demand destruction by region,\" it is noted that each regional market experienced significant declines, with the West, for instance, seeing only a minor 1.3% increase from last year but still facing one of its worst Marches since the 1990s. The South, Midwest, and Northeast all show marked reductions as well, comparing unfavorably to preceding years, such as a 30.4% drop in the Southern region compared to 2022. Despite stabilized mortgage rates returning to historical norms above 5% as described in \"But mortgage rates are in the historically normal-ish range,\" there is industry discontent with these rates as they prefer higher prices. Single-family home prices slightly increased in March, but the rate of increase is slowing, reflecting reduced demand. Regional markets like Austin and Oaklands among others have seen significant price adjustments, reflecting economic shifts across various regions."

In the section \"The homebuilders in Q1,\" notable builders like Lennar and PulteGroup demonstrate varying strategies; Lennar has increased sales but faced margin contraction, while PulteGroup increased prices, leading to lower sales. The article notes in \"Overall prices continue to wobble lower\" that the median contract price for new single-family houses reduced to $403,600, as builders offer incentives such as mortgage-rate buydowns. In \"Inventory for sale by region,\" regional disparities reveal inventory gluts in the South, West, Midwest, and Northeast, with the South seeing the largest share of sales. Lastly, in the \"Sales overall rose to decent levels\" section, new house sales rose 6.2% year-over-year, particularly in the South, with supply levels dropping to 7.1 months, contrasting the faltering existing home sales market over the past two years."

Absurdity Comes Unglued\" by Wolf Richter delves into the recent sharp declines in condo prices across major U.S. cities. In \"Price drops from peak (charts below),\" it is noted that Austin and Oakland have experienced some of the most significant price drops, with prices declining 22% and 20% respectively. Florida cities, particularly St. Petersburg, Jacksonville, and Naples, are highlighted for their accelerating price decreases. The article attributes this trend, discussed in \"Condo dynamics are different,\" to economic factors like inflation and interest rate changes, alongside regional challenges and market saturation in vacation rentals. Rising HOA fees and Fannie Mae's extensive \"mortgage blacklist\" further impact the market, making financing and sales challenging. The section \"The absurd price spikes come unglued\" attributes the initial condo price surges to earlier Federal Reserve policies that have now reversed, causing mortgage rates to rise and market dynamics to adjust. Historical data from Zillow indicates that despite recent declines, cities like Austin and Oakland still show considerable long-term gains since 2000. Overall, the article suggests these trends reflect broader economic shifts, impacting cities differently based on local housing trends and macroeconomic changes."

        "summary": "The article \"Despite Turmoil in Stocks: Financial Conditions, Financial Stress, Junk-Bond Spreads Still in La-La Land or Barely Exiting\" by Wolf Richter on Wolf Street examines the surprising stability of financial conditions amidst stock market volatility. Despite chaotic movements in stocks and a reassessment of valuations, broader financial indicators like the Chicago Fed's National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) and the St. Louis Fed Financial Stress Index show only moderate tightening or stress, remaining below historical distress levels seen in past crises. The NFCI has risen slightly to -0.42 from ultra-loose levels, indicating financial conditions are looser than average despite the Federal Reserve's efforts to curb inflation through tightening measures. Similarly, the St. Louis Fed Financial Stress Index recently moved into positive territory at +0.55, signaling slightly higher, but still manageable, financial stress. Additionally, junk bond spreads have widened since January but remain narrow by historical standards, suggesting a continued appetite for risk among investors even as financial conditions tighten. These stable credit market conditions imply that the Federal Reserve might not need to aggressively alter its policy in response to stock market fluctuations, as these other key financial metrics do not currently show significant distress."

        "summary": "In Wolf Richter's article for Wolf Street titled \"The Spread between 10-Year Treasury Yield & Mortgage Rates Is Historically Wide and Widened Further: Some Thoughts,\" the discussion centers on the historically high gap between the 10-year Treasury yield and mortgage rates, which currently surpasses typical levels observed over the past five decades. This widening spread, influenced by factors such as the Federal Reserve's monetary policy and broader market conditions, indicates increased risks or uncertainties in lending. Specifically, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate usually follows the 10-year Treasury yield but now includes a larger varying spread. This was previously narrowed during the Fed's quantitative easing (QE) when it purchased mortgage-backed securities (MBS), reducing mortgage rates significantly. However, with the cessation of these purchases and the Fed's quantitative tightening (QT) starting mid-2022, which includes offloading MBS, the spread widened markedly, reaching levels last seen in 1986 before slightly narrowing. Recent fluctuations saw the 30-year mortgage rate climb to 6.83%, with a significant 2.50 percentage point spread over the 10-year Treasury yield at 4.33%. These dynamics reflect market volatility due to bond market reactions to Fed rate cuts and inflation concerns. In \"By Wolf Richter for Wolf Street,\" it's noted that inflationary concerns lead investors to demand higher yields, impacting Treasury market dynamics and yield manipulation attempts. The Fed's previous MBS purchasing acted as interest-rate repression but ceased post-2021 inflation surge. This QT impacted the Fed's balance sheet, focusing on Treasury securities while the MBS market became independent, shaping the current spread between mortgage rates and Treasury yields. The changes underscore a market-driven determination of mortgage rates despite federal interventions in Treasury securities."

While notable cities like San Diego, Los Angeles, and New York saw narrowing YoY price gains, others faced declining prices since their 2022 peaks, notably Austin with a 23.2% drop. This change comes after a peak of the Housing Bubble in mid-2021 driven by mortgage rates below 3%, which climbed above 6% since 2022, reducing demand as affordability plummeted. The section discusses how current declines saw cities like Austin, Phoenix, and San Antonio experiencing significant descents toward 2021 price levels, contrasting with markets like Seattle and Salt Lake City that recorded minimal gains. The article also covers metros like Miami, which saw a 1.5% YoY price decline, contrasting with markets such as Columbus and San Diego, which showed modest gains. Cities like Los Angeles and Philadelphia maintained growth, albeit at a reduced pace compared to February, while Chicago, New York, San Jose, and others noted a slowdown in price rise, with San Jose and New York leading with 5.5% and 4.8% YoY increases, respectively.

        "summary": "The article from Wolf Street, authored by Wolf Richter, titled \"Oh Elon! Tesla Crushed Further in California in Q1, Non-Tesla EV Sales Soar. Cybertruck Joining Failed Models of Automotive History?\" discusses the decline in Tesla's sales in California, its primary market, during the first quarter of 2025, which dropped to their lowest since the third quarter of 2022. This slump highlights the challenges Tesla faces from increasing competition in the EV sector, with non-Tesla EV sales surging by 36% year-over-year. A significant factor in this shift is the burgeoning variety of competitive EVs from other automakers and the impact of Elon Musk's political ambitions on consumer preferences. While Tesla's overall sales fell by 15.4% year-over-year, non-Tesla EV sales, for the first time, exceeded those of Tesla in Q4 2024, growing by 35.9% to 54,094 vehicles, contributing to a 7.3% increase in overall EV sales. Within Tesla's lineup, the Model Y, despite being the top-selling vehicle in California, saw a 30.3% drop in sales, whereas the Model 3 improved with a 25% sales increase. However, the Cybertruck, along with older models like the Model X and Model S, faced steep declines, casting doubt on the sustainability of Tesla's high-profile products and drawing parallels with well-known automotive failures. This decline is not just confined to California; globally, Tesla's deliveries fell by 13% year-over-year, marking the lowest point since Q2 2022. Unclear reporting of specific model sales, particularly the underperforming Cybertruck, suggests an overall downward trend in parts of Tesla's lineup. Furthermore, the article notes the successful rise of EV models from other automakers, such as the Honda Prologue, underscoring the rapidly changing market landscape where Tesla's dominance is increasingly challenged."

Consequently, Nvidia's H20 chip, crucial for high-performance computing, now faces challenges finding new markets, reflecting the broader impact of geopolitical tensions on tech firms. Anticipating this, Nvidia indicated it would incur up to $5.5 billion in charges in fiscal Q1, with the H20 GPU adhering to existing U.S. export laws due to its reduced interconnection speeds compared to peers like H100 or H200. The company's shares fell significantly after-hours, paralleling declines in major stock indices due to anticipated revenue deceleration prompted by reduced Chinese sales and tightened restrictions, compromising its AI-driven stock value.

The decrease in sales and rising inventory indicate a potential market correction, with Toronto driving this trend. Despite this nationwide slump, some metropolitan areas like Vancouver, Victoria, and Calgary continue to see rising prices, suggesting localized market conditions at play, as discussed in \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET.\" Specifically, single-family home prices dropped 1.1% from February, decreasing 1.7% year-over-year and are now 16.5% below their February 2022 peak.

        "summary": "In the article \"Our Drunken Sailors Are Back: Sales of Used Vehicles Surge in March, same as New Vehicles. Retail Sales Might Look Good\" from Wolf Street, Wolf Richter highlights a surge in used vehicle sales in March, matching the growth in new vehicle sales, indicating that consumers are spending despite economic concerns. The section by Wolf Richter explains that used vehicle sales increased by 12.8% year-over-year, reaching 1.66 million units, driven by tax refunds, which rose by 5.0% to $211 billion. This aligns with a 13.3% increase in new vehicle sales and supports robust consumer participation in the market. The surge is attributed to high new vehicle prices, prompting a shift towards used options, and consumers' desire to upgrade vehicles. The article suggests this trend may boost retail sales in other sectors too. In the section \"But used-vehicle inventory is tight,\" it describes how dealership inventories dropped to 2.14 million used vehicles amid a semiconductor shortage in 2021 and 2022, resulting in fewer new and subsequently used vehicles in the market. Fewer lease returns also contribute to the inventory squeeze, causing rising retail prices since September. In the final section, \"Used-vehicle retail prices started rising 7 months ago,\" Wolf Richter notes that after a 55% price increase in 2021 and 2022, prices fell somewhat in 2023 and early 2024 before rising again in September 2024 due to strong demand and tight inventory, with March prices seeing modest increases unadjusted for seasonality."

        "summary": "Wolf Richter's article on Wolf Street discusses recent movements in financial markets, focusing on the 10-Year Treasury yield, the yield curve, mortgage rates, and the dollar's value. In the section titled \"10-Year Treasury Yield Snaps Back to February\u2019s 4.5%, Yield Curve Re-Un-Inverts, Mortgage Rates Back at 7%,\" it is explained that the White House initially succeeded in lowering long-term Treasury yields and the dollar, but these changes were unsustainable, as indicated by the 10-Year Treasury yield's return to 4.5% and the recompletion of the yield curve's inversion, leading to mortgage rates climbing back to 7%. \"Brought Out Demand\" reveals strong foreign demand at recent Treasury auctions, with investors accepting the current yields, demonstrating stability within historical patterns. \"Yield Curve Re-Un-Inverted, Still with a Sag in the Middle\" highlights that despite some recovery in longer-term yields, a noticeable drop remains in the mid-section of the curve, suggesting that ideally, longer-term yields should be higher. \"Mortgage Rates Are Back Over 7%\" emphasizes the return of mortgage rates above 7%, a figure historically considered low before quantitative easing but now viewed as stable. Finally, \"The Dollar Bash-Down\" discusses the White House's effort to lower the dollar's value, noting that although successful, the dollar remains robust within its three-year range. Despite media alarmism, historical trends suggest such declines are often temporary, with the dollar historically rebounding after downturns. Overall, the article portrays fluctuations in financial markets as part of recurring historical patterns, with current fears often exaggerated by media narratives."

        "summary": "The article \"OMG the Dollar Is Collapsing, or Whatever\" by Wolf Richter on Wolf Street addresses the misconception that the U.S. dollar is collapsing. It underscores that despite concerns, the dollar remains stable within its established three-year range, which indicates resilience. In the section \"The Dollar Index (DXY),\" it is noted that although the DXY, which includes a basket of currencies like the euro and yen, has decreased from a high of 109 to 99.78, it is still within its historical range and higher than previous lows, such as 71. The article further discusses that while the dollar may fluctuate, its current value remains favorable for businesses adapting to market conditions. It remains the dominant global reserve currency, outpacing the euro and other currencies despite diversification by central banks. The final section, \"Current Dynamics,\" mentions the mixed picture presented by the dollar index, which prompts opportunities for economic recalibration and growth possibilities, indicating a shift towards normalcy in the economic environment after periods of low interest rates and market exuberance. Overall, the discourse highlights the dollar's long-term robustness, suggesting that reported fluctuations are not indicative of a collapse but rather part of a dynamic economic landscape."

        "summary": "The article \"PPI Pushed into Negative by Dropping Prices of Many Goods and Services\" by Wolf Richter on Wolf Street examines the trends in the Producer Price Index (PPI), which is a critical marker of inflation at the wholesale level as it tracks changes in selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. The article notes that the PPI, which can initially reflect the effects of tariffs on production costs, recently experienced a significant decrease as observed in March 2025, primarily due to notable declines in gasoline and services prices. Some sectors like steel mill products and legal services, however, witnessed price increases despite this overall drop. The core PPI, excluding food and energy, also saw a modest decline, marking the smallest six-month increase since the previous year, while the services PPI declined for the second month in a row, although both still exhibited year-over-year growth at a reduced pace. Nonresidential construction PPI slightly increased, maintaining high construction costs after surges in 2021 and 2022, with particular growth in factory construction due to technological investments. This variance in different PPI components suggests a temporary dip before a possible rebound in wholesale prices, influenced by contrasting price trajectories in sectors like construction and automated manufacturing."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter delves into the evolving patterns of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), emphasizing notable price escalations in food, housing, and medical care. This surge marks the most severe food inflation since 2022 and a concerning rise in housing costs recently. Contrarily, the CPI also experienced declines in gasoline and sectors like travel services, including lodging, airline fares, and rental cars, which provide a counterbalance to the rising costs in other areas. The CPI saw a slight monthly decline of 0.05% in March, leading to a six-month annualized deceleration to 3.1%, while the \"Core\" CPI excluding food and energy showed a minor month-to-month rise of 0.06%, indicating a sharp slowdown. Year-over-year, the overall CPI and Core CPI experienced deceleration in growth, attributed to significant drops in travel services and motor vehicle insurance costs, although durable goods prices recorded minor increases month-to-month. Within \"Core services,\" representing essential sectors like housing and medical care, the index registered a modest 0.11% increase in March, reflecting deceleration in inflationary pressures while contending with a steep fall in travel-related services and insurance prices. Housing components of core services detailed a 4.9% annualized jump in the Owners\u2019 Equivalent of Rent (OER) CPI and a 4.1% increase in the Rent of Primary Residence CPI, alongside disparities in rent and home prices across different metropolitan areas. Meanwhile, \"Prices of Goods\" captured a minor uptick in used vehicle prices, driven by tax refund season but showing a broader decrease since early 2022, whereas new vehicle prices maintained stability due to a surge in sales, especially in Q1 2025. Examining \"Food Inflation,\" March's CPI for \"Food at home\" indicated a 0.5% month-to-month increase, marking a significant annualized rise tied to severe price hikes in essentials like eggs due to avian flu. In clothing-related categories, \"Apparel and footwear\" CPI showed a minor 0.4% non-annualized increase with a 0.3% year-over-year rise, suggesting relatively stable trends amid broader economic inflation pressures. Lastly, the \"Energy\" section noted a decline in gasoline prices, sharply falling 6.3% month-to-month from February, driving the energy CPI down by 2.4% but counteracted by rising electricity and natural gas prices."

Highlighted in the section by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street, the article discusses how these volatile spikes and drops resemble patterns from the Dotcom Bust and Financial Crisis, prompting investors to question the reliability of their stock investments in such unpredictable times. In \"By Wolf Richter for Wolf Street,\" it\u2019s noted that the stock markets are now highly reactive to the President's announcements, often overshadowing other fundamental factors like corporate earnings or technological developments. Recent fluctuations were triggered by Trump's tariff announcements, with significant gains marked in major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite upon the announcement of adjusted tariffs. These tariff changes, aiming to negotiate better trade terms, led to dramatic market surges reminiscent of historical financial downturns. The article further discusses how these market reactions highlight the impact of high-frequency trading and algorithmic responses to political news, with the Federal Reserve's stance on interest rates and quantitative tightening also influencing economic dynamics amidst this ongoing volatility. Overall, the piece portrays the challenges investors face as the stock market's sensitivity to political communications increases."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter, titled \"Shadow Inventory of Vacant Homes Suddenly Piles on the Market in Texas. New Listings, Active Listings Spike to Highest for March in Many Years,\" discusses the recent surge in new and active real estate listings in Texas cities such as Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth, Austin, and San Antonio. This influx, primarily composed of properties withheld during the Covid pandemic, has led to a historic increase in available properties for March. Despite this surge, home sales have significantly dropped, creating a more competitive housing market. The Texas housing market now reflects a backlog of supply competing for fewer buyers as demand diminishes. Similar trends are observed in states like Florida, where rising inventories coincide with slowing sales. Notably, cities like Dallas-Fort Worth and Austin have seen significant increases in active listings, indicating a growing oversupply, while Austin experiences price declines as the market normalizes after a pandemic-induced price spike. Houston too saw new listings surge in March 2025, leading to a year-over-year increase in housing inventory, but buyers remain hesitant with declining pending sales of existing homes. This scenario of rising inventories and high prices indicates a prolonged adjustment period for the housing market."

        "summary": "The article \"But this Kind of Dynamic Sprinkles Additional Cold Water on the Idea of a Looming Recession\" by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street highlights the resilience of the private sector in the face of economic uncertainty, focusing on the Inland Empire Purchasing Managers Index (PMI). The PMI has surged to its highest level since early 2021, with new orders reaching record highs, reflecting a robust economic environment that challenges the notion of an impending recession. The next section, authored by Richter, discusses corporate frontrunning of tariffs contributing to increased activity in the US goods sector, with companies rushing to import goods before tariffs are enforced. This activity benefits the US economy and could shift some manufacturing to domestic facilities, potentially increasing vehicle sales and signaling a positive economic outlook. The \"Inland Empire PMI\" section reports a spike to 65.7 in March, indicating robust growth in Southern California's manufacturing sector, with continued growth in production, new orders, and employment indices, despite potential long-term sustainability concerns. However, challenges persist with supply chain delays despite stabilizing commodity prices, highlighted in the \"Economic challenges and emerging opportunities\" section. The article concludes with concerns about the temporary nature of business activity surges due to tariff and trade-policy uncertainties. Despite these challenges, the private sector's dynamism could mean recession fears are overly pessimistic as businesses adapt to dynamic environments, suggesting that coordinated planning could sustain opportunities."

In the section \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET,\" Richter discusses how recent market fluctuations, particularly after the spread of disinformation, severely impacted traders. Since March 27, long-term US Treasury yields have been volatile, initially dropping sharply alongside falling stock prices in a typical fear trade, before rebounding by week's end. The 10-year Treasury yield saw its most significant rise since June 13, 2022, amid unpredictable stock market behavior. The \"The stock market went crazy today\" section details an extraordinary day for the stock market, marked by wild fluctuations and a false report about Trump pausing tariffs. This fake news led the S&P 500 to surge 8.5% within an hour, only to retract after debunking, with record trading volumes of 29 billion shares. Despite this turmoil, the market closed with a minor decline of 0.2%. The author questions the SEC's response to fake news while acknowledging its focus on cryptocurrency regulation. The article underscores the unprecedented volatility of the trading session and anticipates the forthcoming March CPI report's influence on the bond market, amid ongoing concerns over inflation and recession."

This move signifies the BoJ's participation in global QT efforts, which had previously been led by the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. The section \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET\" details how the BoJ's strategy involves winding down its Japanese government securities holdings along with a significant contraction of its pandemic-era loan portfolio, reflecting a retreat from financial crisis measures. Additionally, \"Joining the Fed\u2019s and ECB\u2019s QT party\" section emphasizes that while the Fed and ECB have reduced their combined assets by approximately $5 trillion, the BoJ, although slow to join, is part of this global shift towards reduced financial support.

        "summary": "In the Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter, the housing market in Florida is experiencing significant changes as inventories of existing homes surged to their highest levels since at least 2016, driven by massive increases in Tampa, Miami, and Orlando. The section \"Inventories of Existing Homes in Florida Spike in March to Highest since at Least 2016, Massive Jumps in Tampa, Miami, Orlando, as Buyers Are on Strike\" highlights that active home listings in Florida reached 177,006 in March 2025, a 34% year-over-year rise, with Tampa, Miami, and Orlando showing substantial hikes in available inventory. The hesitancy from buyers forces sellers to compete with an increased inventory of new houses, which in the southern U.S., led by Florida, has surpassed previous housing bust levels with 296,000 new single-family homes for sale in February 2025. Sellers are adjusting to these market conditions with price reductions, as seen in the 11% drop in the median listing price per square foot from its peak in May 2023 and a 17% decline in the median per-home price since June 2022. The section \"By Wolf Richter for Wolf Street\" notes that builders are skillfully managing inventory through price modifications and incentives, which intensifies the competition for homeowners trying to sell existing homes amid limited demand. As buyers remain on strike, this combination of increased inventory and strategic price adjustments by builders creates a challenging market landscape for sellers."

In the section \"The Stock Market May Be in Trouble and Consumers May Be in a Sour Mood, But the Labor Market Is Just Fine,\" it is highlighted that despite ongoing concerns over factors like government job cuts and trade tariffs, the labor market remains robust, with job creation continuing at a healthy pace. This strength in employment might counterbalance some of the pessimism affecting other sectors, indicating a complex yet resilient economic environment. The section, \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET,\" reveals a surge in the labor market with March seeing an increase of 228,000 in nonfarm payrolls, exceeding expectations even as federal jobs and trade uncertainties pose challenges. Although federal government employment decreased slightly, it is a minor component of overall employment. Furthermore, average hourly earnings rose by 0.25%, showing consistent wage growth. Moreover, \"Unemployment rose by 31,000, remaining consistent with trends since July\" indicates that the unemployment rate slightly increased to 4.2%, still below the Federal Reserve's projected 4.4% for 2025, showcasing economic strength.

        "summary": "In a Wolf Street article, Wolf Richter discusses the Federal Reserve's recent efforts in Quantitative Tightening (QT), highlighting a $33 billion reduction in its balance sheet during March, resulting in a $2.24 trillion decline from the peak, bringing its total assets to $6.72 trillion\u2014the lowest since May 2020. Since the end of Quantitative Easing (QE) in April 2022, the Fed's balance sheet has decreased by 25%, effectively reversing nearly half of the $4.81 trillion pandemic-era QE. Specifically, the QT efforts have led to a $22.5 billion reduction in Treasury securities, marking a 47.5% decline from the pandemic acquisition peak, limited by a monthly cap of $25 billion. Meanwhile, mortgage-backed securities (MBS) holdings decreased by $14.3 billion, declining by 20% since April 2022, with a total 40% reduction of pandemic-era QE MBS. The Fed exclusively owns agency MBS protected against borrower defaults, yet reductions are constrained by declining home sales and refinancing. Additionally, the Fed's bank liquidity facilities, including the Bank Term Funding Program and Loans to the FDIC set up during the March 2023 bank panic, have become inactive, with Central Bank Liquidity Swaps, Repos, and Discount Window activity minimal. The assets-to-GDP ratio, previously stable before 2009, surged during QE to 35.5% at the pandemic's peak but has since fallen to 22.6%, a rate not seen since 2013, following economic growth and QT measures totaling nearly $2.24 trillion."

        "summary": "In the Wolf Street article written by Wolf Richter, titled \"Stocks Plunge as the Market Understood What Tariffs Are: A Tax on Corporate Profit Margins,\" the article discusses the sharp decline in the stock market as investors belatedly realized that tariffs act as a tax on corporate profit margins. President Donald Trump reinforced this understanding in a discussion, explaining how tariffs aim to encourage companies to relocate production to the US by imposing a financial deterrent on corporate profits that escape US taxes. This strategy challenges the economic practices of corporations like Big Pharma, which exploit low-tax jurisdictions like Ireland while maintaining operations in the US without reporting domestic profits, contributing to the US's significant trade deficit with Ireland. The article highlights that while companies have long understood the detrimental impact of tariffs, markets only recently started reacting, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq experiencing notable declines, although they still show long-term growth. The narrative emphasizes that, contrary to perceptions of tariffs as a sales tax, the primary objectives are to bolster domestic production, as demonstrated by investments in sectors like automotive and semiconductors, and to promote sustainable economic development over maintaining inflated stock prices. The delayed but significant revival of domestic manufacturing, supported by initiatives like the CHIPS Act, represents a significant shift in US economic policy focusing on manufacturing over the less impactful service exports."

This growth, mainly driven by an increase in consumer demand, led to a 4.8% rise in vehicle sales compared to the previous year and marked the sixth consecutive month of year-over-year sales growth. Veteran automakers such as General Motors and Honda posted notable sales increases of 16.7% and 15.8%, respectively, with GM seeing a significant 94% rise in electric vehicle sales. Hyundai-Kia also saw impressive growth at 10.4%, while Ford's overall sales declined by 1.3% despite an 11.5% increase in their EV segment. Conversely, Toyota's sales remained relatively flat with only a 0.9% increase, as they pivot toward EV development, and Stellantis continued its \"death spiral\" with a 12% decrease in sales. Nissan managed to increase its sales by 5.7%, whereas Tesla experienced a notable decline of 13% in global sales, its lowest since the second quarter of the previous year. In March 2025, new vehicle sales, not adjusted for seasonality, rose by 10.7% to 1.585 million vehicles, benefiting from a favorable tax-refund season. Despite previous affordability issues due to price hikes in 2021-2022, automakers countered high prices with incentives, averaging $3,059 per vehicle or about 6.1% of the MSRP. However, the strong March demand led to a subsequent reduction in these incentives, highlighting robust consumer spending."

At its peak, Newsmax's market cap reached $21 billion, a staggering figure for a media company with only $171 million in annual revenue, surpassing News Corp\u2019s market cap of $16 billion, despite News Corp's larger revenue of $10 billion. These fluctuations reflect the extreme volatility and unpredictability of the market, likened to a video game where serious fundamentals appear irrelevant. Even at $50 per share, Newsmax stock shows a 440% increase from the IPO price, despite being a small and unprofitable company. According to their SEC filing on IPO day, Newsmax listed revenues of $171 million in 2024 with a net loss of $72 million, showing a similar financial situation to the previous year. The trading frenzy disregarded these financial realities, underscoring the speculative and unpredictable nature of today's market."

        "summary": "In the article \"Oh Elon! Tesla Deliveries Plunge as Musk Crushes One of the Most Successful Consumer Brands\" by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street, the focus is on the significant decline in Tesla's vehicle deliveries, a worrying trend affecting the once-celebrated consumer brand. Elon Musk's actions and decisions are under intense scrutiny as they influence Tesla's market performance, raising concerns about the potential repercussions for Tesla's reputation and stock value. In the section \"By Wolf Richter for Wolf Street,\" the report details that in the first quarter of 2025, Tesla's vehicle deliveries declined sharply by 13% compared to the previous year, marking the lowest numbers since Q2 2022. Notably, Model 3 and Model Y deliveries fell by 12.4%, and deliveries for other models, like the Cybertruck, Model S, and Model X, saw a more pronounced drop of 24.3%. Despite Tesla attributing reduced Model Y deliveries to a production changeover and remaining hopeful due to an ongoing ramp-up, the disconnect between planned Cybertruck production and current low delivery numbers is highlighted. In \"Despite expectations for the Cybertruck to become significant in Tesla's financials, its current status is more of a liability than an asset,\" it is noted that the Cybertruck\u2019s relevance to financials is currently a liability, while the long-awaited Cybercab remains unavailable without necessary operation permits. Additionally, competitors like Waymo, surpassing Tesla in the autonomous vehicle race with driverless services launched in various cities, put into question the future impact of Tesla's Cybercab amidst competition and regulatory difficulties. The final section, \"The decline in Tesla's popularity, particularly in California, its largest US market, further underlines its challenges,\" underscores Tesla's decreasing sales, especially in California, since 2023, resulting in a 24% drop by mid-2024 with non-Tesla EVs surpassing Tesla in market share due to a 45% increase in their sales. This consumer shift suggests growing discontent with Musk's approach, challenging Tesla's dominance in previously favorable regions."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter titled \"As Life Happens, 'Locked-in' Homeowners Pay Off Below-4% Mortgages: Share Drops to 54%, Lowest since Q4 2020,\" analyzes the declining share of homeowners with mortgages below 4%, which has dropped to 54.1% in Q4, down from a peak of 65.1% in Q1 2022. This decrease is attributed to life circumstances necessitating mortgage payoffs or refinancing into higher rates. The article delves into Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARMs) and their exposure to interest rate hikes, leading to payment shocks as benchmark rates surged over 5% in 2023. Consequently, the share of homeowners with mortgages above 6% has risen to its highest level since 2016, although the current 18% share remains below historical averages. The \"locked-in effect,\" where homeowners cling to favorable mortgage rates, has reduced housing inventory and lowered sales, frustrating the brokerage and mortgage lending industries. However, changing life circumstances are gradually diminishing this effect, causing transitions into higher-rate mortgages."

        "summary": "In the article \"Not Another Free Lunch: Don\u2019t Let Fannie and Freddie Turn Back into GSEs\" on Wolf Street, authors Alex J. Pollock and Edward J. Pinto critique the potential reversion of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac back into government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) post-conservatorship. The authors argue that this move would recreate an unfair financial framework where private shareholders profit from government-backed guarantees, effectively socializing risk while privatizing profits, a structure they deem inequitable. They explain in \"By Alex J. Pollock & Edward J. Pinto\" that releasing Fannie and Freddie from their nearly 17-year conservatorship post-2008 financial crisis poses challenges. The U.S. Treasury holds significant stakes, necessitating either massive refinancing or taxpayer funding to exit conservatorship. Despite \"privatization\" efforts, continued government guarantees sustain Fannie and Freddie's operations, ultimately undermining their fully private status due to their \"too big to fail\" nature. The section \"How Much Should a \u201cReleased\u201d Fannie and Freddie Pay for Their Government Guarantee?\" delves into the fees these entities should incur for this backing, proposing a twofold fee structure: a Risk Fee akin to FDIC-associated fees and a Current Cost Fee to mitigate Treasury borrowing costs magnified by competition from Fannie and Freddie\u2019s securities. These fees, constituting a crucial taxpayer subsidy, require fair compensation to offset raised Treasury debt expenses. In \"The Total Fee,\" Pollock and Pinto estimate a necessary payment of $46 billion on $7.6 trillion in liabilities, equating to 128% of pretax profit, underscoring the importance of recompensing public risk. The article concludes by rejecting unjustified private profits enabled by government guarantees and recommends retaining Fannie and Freddie as government entities if they cannot meet these financial obligations, advocating against a continued \"free lunch\" for shareholders at the expense of taxpayers."

Despite this rise in government layoffs and discharges, the labor market remains robust, driven by strong hiring in the private sector, indicating tightened labor market conditions with sustained demand for labor. Additionally, the section by Wolf Richter on Wolf Street highlights the relationship between quits, job openings, hires, and layoffs, emphasizing significant labor churn during 2021 and 2022, with workers moving for better opportunities causing high volumes of job openings and hires. By mid-2022, large-scale layoffs in Big Tech led to a decline in quitting rates, job openings, and hires. By late 2022, while the labor market had calmed, job openings remained above historical averages and layoffs stayed low, indicating a stable employment environment. By February, there was a slight increase in layoffs and discharges, remaining below pre-pandemic levels, with employers retaining their workforce. Although government layoffs rose, the overall numbers were still minimal historically, maintaining stability within nonfarm payrolls."

        "summary": "The article from Wolf Street, \"Status of US Dollar as Global Reserve Currency: Central Banks Diversify into Other Currencies and Gold,\" examines the evolving landscape of global reserves as central banks diversify beyond the US dollar into \"nontraditional\" currencies and gold. This diversification, motivated by economic shifts, geopolitical tensions, and changing trade dynamics, has seen the US dollar's share in global reserves gradually decline, with the dollar's share of total allocated exchange reserves at its lowest since 1994, per the IMF's COFER data. \"Wolf Richter\" highlights how this affects the US's ability to fund its fiscal and trade deficits as USD-denominated assets held by central banks, such as Treasury securities, decrease. \"The major reserve currencies\" section notes that while the euro maintains its share, now at $2.27 trillion, the USD's share has been encroached upon by nontraditional currencies. \"The surge of the 'nontraditional reserve currencies'\" shows the share of currencies like the Japanese yen, British pound, and others rising, while the Chinese renminbi has lost ground due to issues like capital controls and convertibility. \"The other diversification: gold\" discusses how central banks, after decades of divestment, have increased gold reserves over the past 20 years, with nations like Russia and China accumulating significant amounts and leading a global increase of about 6,221 tonnes since 2006. This strategic shift underscores the stability and independence of gold from foreign currency fluctuations."

The article suggests that while financial markets can influence recessions, other factors such as monetary policy and geopolitical tensions also play important roles. It highlights the importance of monitoring both financial markets and broader economic indicators when assessing recession risks. In the section \"Wolf Richter with Adam Taggart on Thoughtful Money,\" Wolf Richter discusses the impact of the real economy on stock markets and highlights a shift in focus unsettling investors, particularly referring to patterns observed in events like the Dotcom bust. The reference to \"Where did the Trump put go?\" indicates a perceived change in economic or market conditions previously linked to policies or incentives from the Trump administration.

McNellis, the narrative revolves around a commercial real estate dispute between a landlord, Sam, and his restaurant tenant, Umberto, amid the economic decline caused by the pandemic. As rental market values plummeted, Sam faced a dilemma when Umberto questioned the proposed rent of $60 per square foot against the market rate of $20. Instead of settling amicably, the dispute escalated to binding arbitration, resulting in a ruling at the market rate that negatively impacted Sam's income and property value. The article emphasizes the benefits of reaching a compromise over pursuing costly and unpredictable litigation. The second section reveals a similar case faced by Sam, reinforcing the importance of flexibility and compromise in commercial agreements during challenging times. While arbitration is generally quicker than traditional lawsuits, it can still result in unforeseen financial and emotional costs, emphasizing the adage that a poor settlement can often outweigh a successful lawsuit. Ultimately, the article advises against the subjective belief in one's legal case, highlighting how legal battles can lead to regret and diminished property value over time."

In the section by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET, the Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index saw its most significant month-over-month increase in 13 months, driven particularly by non-housing services like recreational services, marking an end to a six-month deflationary period for durable goods. In the section \"On a year-over-year basis,\" the overall PCE price index showed a consistent 2.5% increase, reflecting maintained upward pressure above the Fed's 2.0% target. The Core PCE price index observed a slight year-over-year increase to 2.8%, with Core Services PCE rising to 3.6%. The Durable goods price index had a lesser decrease, indicating stabilizing prices. These trends indicate a complex inflation environment, as core services and durable goods drive inflation, with transportation services being the only category exhibiting a decline in February. This illustrates the intricate inflation dynamics outside housing, challenging the Fed's strategic timing on rate cuts, initiated when inflation seemed subdued."

The section by Wolf Richter notes that high interest payments, which consumed 35.6% of tax receipts in Q4 despite a slight improvement from the previous quarter, remain a significant concern. These payments reached $281 billion due to increased national debt and fluctuating interest rates, although some relief came from a Federal rate cut affecting short-term debt. Tax receipts increased by $44 billion from Q3, driven by strong financial markets, capital gains taxes, employment, wages, and inflation. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) tracks tax receipts for general budget expenditures excluding specific uses, emphasizing inflation's impact on fiscal management. Interest payments have surged since 2022 due to rising debt and interest rates, pushing the Debt-to-GDP ratio to 121.9% and the Deficit-to-GDP ratio to 6.3% in 2024, above sustainable levels. The interest-payment-to-GDP ratio underscores the economic burden, suggesting that policymakers must address unsustainable debt growth to avoid inflationary risks. Despite economic growth expectations, Congress struggles with substantial policy changes to manage this imbalance. The US can avert default by printing money, but excessive creation risks inflation and financial instability."

In the South, despite a 6.2% rise in pending home sales from January, February recorded the lowest numbers ever, with Florida and Texas experiencing significant growth in active listings. An 18% year-over-year increase in new single-family home listings indicates the region is seeking market stabilization with price reductions. Similarly, the West saw a drastic decline in pending sales to the second-lowest level, with California's active listings spiking by 43%, mirroring the 60% rise in new single-family house inventory since 2019. The Northeast's pending home sales decreased by 0.9% from January, marking February as the worst on record, with a notable 34.6% drop since 2020, signaling a persistent downward trend. The Midwest fared slightly better, with a minor 0.7% increase from January, yet February remained the worst on record for the region, maintaining a 32.8% decline since 2020. Nationally, the National Association of Realtors data highlights a pending home sales recovery from January's record low, despite remaining the worst February historically. High home prices alongside elevated mortgage rates, driven by inflation and national debt, continue to challenge the market. Pending sales data, based on signed contracts, exclude potential transaction failures due to financing or unexpected cost issues, leaving the actual completion rates uncertain."

The \"Home Buyers Still on Strike\" section highlights the stubbornness of potential buyers unwilling to overextend financially amid current market conditions, contributing to a persistent housing market strike. In the \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET\" section, Richter explains that mortgage rates have stabilized at over 6.7%, reminiscent of pre-2009 levels, but when paired with high property prices, demand decreased, with a 24% drop in existing home sales since 2019 and a 42% fall in mortgage applications to purchase homes, elucidating the frozen state of the housing market despite declining prices in some areas. The section notes improved refinancing activity from its early 2023 low, with a 49% increase year-over-year, although it's still down significantly from 2019 and 2021 levels, reflecting the detrimental link between rising mortgage rates and refinancing, as people reticently refinance due to economic need. The supply of unsold homes is at its highest since before 2019; however, buyers await better price and rate conditions, with hopes that declining prices, improved household incomes, and inflationary pressures might stabilize the market eventually, hinting that the buyers' strike now in its third year could shift as economic conditions improve."

Builders have cut prices and offered incentives, boosting sales by 18% year-over-year, despite inventory remaining substantial at a 7.6-month supply. The \"West: Inventory surges to highest since December 2007\" section reports a similar situation, with Western inventory reaching 120,000 houses, marking a 60% rise from 2019 levels. Despite accounting for 24% of US new housing inventory, sales have dropped by 14% year-over-year, requiring builders to employ strategic pricing and marketing to stimulate buyer interest amidst a challenging 10-month inventory supply. \"The other two regions\" discusses how the Midwest and Northeast contribute minimally to national trends, with stable inventories and sales in both regions.

Finally, \"Median price wobbles along below the 2022 peak\" reveals the median price for new single-family houses has decreased to $414,500, down 10% from the October 2022 peak, as builders continue to use incentives like mortgage-rate buydowns, affecting their profit margins and possibly understating the aggressive pricing strategies used in the market."

The California Attorney General has recommended users to instruct the company to delete their data to prevent inclusion in liquidation proceedings, highlighting concerns about privacy and security if data is acquired by third parties. The \"The article discusses\" section notes the inherent risks of entrusting personal genetic data to financially unstable companies. Initially valued at $6 billion post-IPO through a SPAC merger with Richard Branson's company in 2021, 23andMe's value plummeted to $19 million on officially filing for bankruptcy, as detailed in the \"By Wolf Richter\" section. The company's reliance on a flawed business model focused on genetic testing with limited repeat customers, failure to diversify into personalized medicine, and unsuccessful healthcare service expansions led to revenue declines. Efforts to win back financial stability, like genetic data auctions and cutting costs, were undermined by security breaches such as the 2023 hack, per \"Throughout its decline\". CEO and co-founder Anne Wojcicki faced controversies regarding buyout failures and board resignations. Despite obtaining a debtor-in-possession loan, layoffs and project shutdowns did not prevent the company's financial collapse.

The \"Indicative of 1.5% Q1 real GDP growth\" section notes that the economy is expanding at a 1.9% annualized rate, but the Q1 growth is measured at 1.5%, slightly lower than the previous quarter's 2.3% growth, yet better than expected recession levels. \"Competition limited the pass-through of higher costs to selling price\" illustrates the challenge of rising input costs, especially in manufacturing due to tariffs, causing significant selling price hikes, though efforts to pass these through the supply chain have been hindered by competitiveness. The \"Which will harm profits.\" section highlights the difficulty services face in transferring costs to consumers, potentially harming profitability despite the Federal Reserve's view of subdued inflation positively. Finally, the \"The numbers: above 50 = growth, below 50 = decline\" segment shows the Flash US PMI Composite Output Index at 53.5, indicating growth, with the Services PMI at 54.3, while Manufacturing PMI dipped to 49.8, underscoring the differing trajectories within sectors."

In the section titled \"We can see the strategy here to get long-term yields down,\" the article elaborates the government's strategy to lower long-term yields, including the Fed's hawkish stance on inflation, modifying Treasury issuance towards T-bills during the debt ceiling period, and altering quantitative tightening for Treasury securities while maintaining it for mortgage-backed securities. Despite these tactical efforts, short-term yields of six months or less remain above 4%, as outlined in \"But short-term yields of 6 months or less stay put above 4%,\" signaling market stability and low expectations for imminent rate changes. Notably, \"The yield curve has re-inverted with a sag in the middle\" explores the inverted curve reflecting significant drops in long-term yields compared to stable short-term rates, indicating market assumptions about future economic conditions. However, as discussed in \"But mortgage rates aren\u2019t fully buying into it,\" mortgage rates haven't corresponded proportionally to these Treasury yield updates, leading to a widened spread, as \"The mortgage-rate spread widened\" section amplifies.

        "summary": "In the article \"Fed\u2019s Operating Losses Declined to $78 Billion in 2024, 'Unrealized Losses' Rose to $1.06 Trillion,\" Wolf Richter of Wolf Street highlights several key financial shifts within the Federal Reserve. The section \u201cThe Federal Reserve's audited annual report\u201d indicates that operating losses decreased to $77.6 billion in 2024 from $114 billion the previous year due to a reduced difference between interest income and expenses. Interest income amounted to $158.8 billion, primarily from Treasury and mortgage-backed securities, yet interest expenses were much higher, leading to losses. However, the \u201cunrealized losses\u201d section notes an increase in these losses to $1.06 trillion due to higher yields affecting bond prices. Despite these losses, the \u201cdividend\u201d section reveals that the Fed still paid $1.62 billion in dividends to shareholders of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, following the Federal Reserve Act\u2019s mandate. The section titled \u201cLosses don\u2019t matter to the Fed but matter to the Taxpayer\u201d explains that the Fed's losses, while not directly impacting its solvency due to its ability to create money, significantly affect the Treasury and taxpayers, as the Fed stopped remitting funds to the Treasury in September 2022. Historical remittances were substantial, totaling $1.36 trillion from 2008 to 2022, contributing to the Treasury's flow of tax receipts. With a growing deficit now shown as a negative liability of -$224 billion on the Fed's balance sheet, the Fed anticipates a prolonged duration before profitability returns and remittances resume. This absence of remittances is a concern for taxpayers, underscoring the impact of the Fed's financial condition on the wider fiscal landscape."

        "summary": "The article \"Where Condos Already Came Unglued: 10 Big Cities with Price Drops from 10% to 22% from Peak\" on Wolf Street, by Wolf Richter, explores the substantial decline in condominium prices across ten major U.S. cities, including Austin, Oakland, San Francisco, Detroit, New Orleans, Jacksonville, Denver, Portland, Seattle, and Mesa. Tampa and other markets are also projected to experience similar downturns. Recent data indicates these price drops range from 10% to 22% from their peaks, most of which occurred in mid-2022, with Austin and Oakland experiencing the largest declines of 22% and 20% respectively. This phenomenon signifies broader trends of decreasing urban property values and disparities in the housing market, as some regions undergo rapid devaluation while others continue to see price increases. The analysis, as covered by WOLF STREET, highlights that the Zillow Home Value Index shows this trend predominantly impacts \"mid-tier\" condo prices, suggesting shifts within this market segment. Contributing factors include economic policies, market interventions, Federal Reserve actions, and federal government deficit spending during the pandemic, which are reminiscent of past housing bubbles and financial crises. The adjustments in condo prices are viewed as part of a larger market correction following the pandemic stimulus and an extended period of low interest rates."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter, \"Buyers Strike Not Letting Up: Sales of Existing Homes Have Worst February since 2009, as Inventory Surges,\" highlights the ongoing challenges in the real estate sector, primarily due to high prices leading to demand destruction. The section titled \"Sales of Existing Homes\" notes that in February, home sales fell by 5.2% year-over-year, with 257,000 deals recorded on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, marking a 27% drop from February 2022. Despite a slight monthly increase in the seasonally adjusted annual rate to 4.26 million, this is the worst February performance since 2009. \"Demand Destruction by Region\" discusses regional seasonally adjusted home sales, revealing a slight increase in the South and West, unchanged performance in the Midwest, and a decline in the Northeast compared to prior years. The section \"Highest Supply for February since 2019, Higher than 2018\" reports a 17% rise in home inventory compared to the previous year, with supply levels at their highest for February since 2019. \"Days on the Market\" indicates that homes had a median market duration of 66 days in February, up from 61 days the previous year, showing that properties are taking longer to sell. In \"Median Price for Single-family Houses and Condos,\" the article reveals that the national median price for single-family homes increased slightly to $402,500, resulting in a year-over-year gain of 3.7%, while condos and co-op prices rose by 3.5% to $355,100. Despite some regional price declines, the significant price surge between June 2019 and June 2022 remains a significant factor affecting demand. Notably, cities like Austin and San Francisco have seen considerable price drops since mid-2022. Overall, the article underscores the sustained long-term decline in the housing market, significantly influenced by prior price spikes dampening demand."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article, written by Wolf Richter, explores the Federal Reserve's (Fed) recent actions in response to rising inflation and economic uncertainties, as outlined in several sections. The \"Fed Sticks to Wait-and-See, Sees Only 2 Cuts in 2025, 'Dot Plot' Shifts Hawkish amid Rising Inflation & 'Uncertainties'\" section highlights the Fed's decision to adopt a cautious stance with only two anticipated rate cuts in 2025. This approach reflects concerns over persistent inflation and economic instability. The \"The FOMC and QT\" section describes the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) decision to keep key interest rates unchanged, with one dissenting vote from Christopher Waller who preferred maintaining the current pace of Quantitative Tightening (QT). The Treasury securities' runoff rate will be slowed starting April 1 to address liquidity risks, while Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) QT will remain unchanged. Since July 2022, the Fed has reduced its assets by $2.2 trillion. In \"The 'dot plot.'\" section, the FOMC's \"Summary of Economic Projections\" reveals expectations of only two rate cuts by 2025 with a median target rate of 3.875%, alongside moderate GDP growth and a slightly rising unemployment rate. Inflation projections suggest that the target of 2.0% will not be achieved until 2027. \"What changed in the FOMC\u2019s statement\" explains the FOMC's updated statement, reflecting increased economic uncertainty and adjusting the approach to QT by slowing the pace of Treasury securities' decline while maintaining caps on agency securities. Lastly, \"The whole statement\" summarizes the Committee's commitment to monitoring data to support employment and a 2% inflation rate, maintaining the current federal funds rate target, and slowing securities holdings' decline. Overall, the article emphasizes the Fed's cautious stance given the present economic conditions."

In the section titled \"Who held this $36.2 trillion in Treasury securities at the end of Q4?\" the article states that US federal entities held $7.34 trillion in securities mostly for intragovernmental purposes, while the public held the other $28.83 trillion in traded forms like Treasury bills, notes, and bonds, alongside some non-tradable securities. In \"Who is this \u201cpublic\u201d that holds these bonds: 30.2% are foreign holders,\" the article describes that foreign entities, including central banks from financial centers and regions such as Japan, Brazil, and the Euro Area, collectively held $8.5 trillion but reduced their holdings by $166 billion in Q4. Conversely, Canada increased its holdings, showcasing different strategic approaches. In the section \"Holders in the US are 69.8% of this \u201cpublic\u201d,\" US mutual funds, including money market funds, accounted for $5.5 trillion of the debt, and the Federal Reserve held $4.29 trillion, having decreased its share by $93 billion recently.

The rise is not solely due to the expiration of the temporary GST holiday, indicating deeper economic factors are at play, similar to trends in the US. In February, the Consumer Price Index rose 0.68% from January, with significant increases in food and alcohol prices, while core inflation grew 0.52%. Housing costs rose only 0.16%, showing the inflationary pressure is broad-based and not housing-driven. The National Bank of Canada highlighted that 35 CPI components were rising above the 2% target, above the historical average, leading to recommendations that the Bank of Canada reevaluate anticipated rate cuts despite an improving economy. Policymakers must balance inflationary pressures and economic growth, as inflation remains a pivotal factor in policy decisions unless trade relations improve quickly."

According to the analysis, 21 of the 33 large Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) tracked saw declines from their 2022 peaks. Significant decreases were noted in Austin, San Francisco, and Phoenix, along with San Antonio and Denver. This trend is attributed to the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes and asset reductions, which followed the pandemic-era low rates and extensive quantitative easing (QE) policies. As a result, mortgage rates rose, prompting price corrections. Austin MSA experienced a 23.4% decline since its June 2022 peak, while San Francisco and Phoenix saw declines of 10.6% and 10.1%, respectively. These corrections have led prices to retreat to early 2021-2022 levels for many areas. In contrast, 12 MSAs saw price increases beyond 2022 peaks, though some, such as Miami, have shown recent downturns. The markets that rose after mid-2022, like Baltimore, San Diego, and Washington D.C., reported modest increases, with some areas in stagnation. Philadelphia emerged with notable growth in recent data. The article, segmented into \"The 21 metros below their highs of mid-2022\" and \"The 12 markets that rose after 2022 (but some are now sagging),\" underscores the complexity and variation across local housing markets, influenced by economic conditions and policy changes, emphasizing the importance of localized market analyses."

But a Long Deep Stock Market Rout Will (See Dotcom Bust)\" addresses the potential repercussions of relying too heavily on government spending and cheap overseas labor, underscored by Bessent's emphasis on the importance of real economy over stock market fluctuations. In the section titled \"They\u2019re saying the right things, but it\u2019s OUCH for stocks,\" Scott Bessent notes the need for a \"detox period\" to shift from public to private spending without necessarily causing a recession, although managing this transition is critical to maintaining stability. Also, emphasizing long-term perspectives, Bessent in \"If you start looking at micro horizons, stocks become very risky\" supports policies geared towards sustainable growth over immediate market gains. In \"So where the heck is the Trump put?\" Bessent discusses the lack of a reliable \"Trump put\" for market stability under Trump's policies, suggesting a potential \"Trump call\" for positive market influence instead. Moving to \"Tariffs might cause 'a little disturbance, but we\u2019re OK with that': Trump,\" President Trump acknowledges the temporary disturbance tariffs may cause but sees them as beneficial for domestic manufacturing in the long run, despite automaker concerns. Concluding with \"When will a stock market rout trigger a recession?\" the article reflects on past market declines, like the Dotcom Bust, indicating that while significant downturns could lead to recessions, the current environment of high inflation and a cautious Federal Reserve suggests a nuanced outcome. Overall, the article implies that correcting fiscal issues and supporting domestic manufacturing could offset short-term market-driven recessions for the long-term benefit."

Despite the Federal Reserve's rate hikes, the need for banks to attract cash deposits has lessened due to stabilized demand for loans and liquidity. This reduced competition for depositors' money has resulted in a migration of deposits from traditional banks to MMFs, which offer better yields. MMF interest rates closely align with short-term yields in Treasury and repo markets, while banks set CD rates based on their cash requirements, resulting in varied rates across banks. With banks improving their situations, CD rates have dropped faster than MMF rates, prompting many depositors to move their money to MMFs. By the end of Q4, household MMF balances surged by $261 billion from the previous quarter and $569 billion year-over-year, climbing to $4.39 trillion, while total MMFs peaked at $7.24 trillion in Q4, alongside a substantial inflow during rising interest rates. This trend saw banks raising CD and savings account rates in 2022 to maintain and attract deposits, although some customers shifted to MMFs or T-bills as the deposit competition shifted."

Specifically, the January month-to-month PPI increase was revised up to +0.61%, and the year-over-year PPI to +3.70%, with significant contributions from the services sector. The core PPI was similarly revised upwards. In \"The PPI for February\" section, February's PPI saw no change from the revised January figures, with overall PPI inflation decelerating to an annual growth rate of 3.2%. However, core PPI, excluding food and energy, showed a slight monthly decline, reflecting broader deflationary trends in consumer prices for durable goods. Despite these revisions, the February figures indicated lower energy prices and higher food costs due to the avian flu's impact on egg production. The article highlights ongoing challenges in forecasting inflation accurately and suggests potential upward revisions for February, consistent with recent patterns."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article, written by Wolf Richter, provides an in-depth analysis of the recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) trends. The \"Beneath the Skin of CPI Inflation\" section highlights the February CPI's overall slowing monthly inflation rate, despite increased energy costs from natural gas and electricity, offset by lower gasoline prices. The six-month CPI rate continues to accelerate at the fastest pace since September 2023, exacerbated by rising used vehicle prices. January and February saw CPI increases of 0.47% and 0.22%, respectively, with the six-month CPI increasing by 3.63% annualized. \"The major components, year-over-year\" highlight slight deceleration in overall CPI to 2.82% and Core CPI to 3.11%. Though Core Services CPI rose by 4.12%, it showed a deceleration from January's surge. Under \"Core services\" CPI, the article notes a slowdown in the core services CPI to a 3.1% annualized rate, reflecting post-pandemic shifts in pricing patterns, with service costs rising significantly. \"Housing components of core services\" reveal that both \"Owners\u2019 Equivalent of Rent CPI\" and \"Rent of Primary Residence CPI\" decelerated but maintained upward trends. These indices differ from the Zillow Observed Rent Index, which has spiked considerably since 2020. Motor vehicle maintenance, repair, and insurance costs have surged, as has the \"Food away from home CPI,\" emphasizing the weight of core services in overall CPI. In \"Prices of Goods,\" used vehicle prices continued rising, marking six months of increases and a 34% increase since January 2020, while new vehicle prices remained high amid trading cost concerns from tariffs. \"Food Inflation\" indicates stagnant food at home CPI in February, a 1.8% year-over-year rise, with notable increases in beef and coffee prices, despite stabilizing egg prices. The \"Apparel and footwear\" section describes a 0.6% CPI increase, partially reversing the previous month's decline. Lastly, \"Energy\" notes a 1.0% seasonally adjusted drop in gasoline CPI, though natural gas and electricity price increases led to a modest overall energy CPI rise, driven by high natural gas costs impacting utility rates and electricity production."

This dramatic decrease, marking an 89% drop from its peak, places Kohl's among the so-called \"Imploded Stocks,\" reflecting its failure to effectively compete in the rapidly expanding ecommerce sector. Revealed in the section by Wolf Richter, Kohl's attributes its struggles to \"constrained\" consumers amid declining revenues and net income; its Q4 revenue fell 9.4% and net income dropped 74%, with a noticeable trend of decreasing annual revenues since 2018, highlighting the impact of the ecommerce shopping shift. While ecommerce sales across the market surged by 9.3%, Kohl\u2019s suffered, which Ashley Buchanan's section notes, leading the new CEO to announce more store closures. Buchanan highlights the issue of customers favoring competitors' online offerings over physical stores. The ongoing decline of brick-and-mortar department stores is noted in Wolf Street's segment, showing how giants like Walmart are adapting by emphasizing online sales and grocery options.

These conditions pose challenges for the Federal Reserve, which faces the risk of re-accelerating inflation but plans to adopt a wait-and-see approach to assess impacts on economic stability. By Wolf Richter for Wolf Street, recent months show a strengthening labor market, reversing earlier concerns, with job metrics suggesting renewed confidence and stability. The Fed has decided on caution given climbing inflation since July. Amid the pandemic's reshuffling, companies initially announced layoffs to curb turnover costs but later stabilized by offering better wages and conditions, which reduced churn. The February 2023 section highlights a significant increase in job openings, particularly in the private sector, with layoffs hitting record lows, demonstrating companies' desire to retain workers. Overall, the labor market's improvement supports the Fed's strategy of remaining watchful on hiring trends and unemployment rates."

        "summary": "The article from Wolf Street, written by Wolf Richter, titled \"Price of Natural Gas Futures Up 140% Year-over-Year: One More Reason for Inflation to Not Back off Easily,\" discusses the significant increase in natural gas prices, which have risen 140% year-over-year, greatly complicating efforts to control inflation. Natural gas's critical role in electricity generation, heating, and as a fertilizer feedstock, combined with its export, which constituted 19% of U.S. production in 2024, amplifies upward cost pressure on consumer goods and services. The price of U.S. natural gas futures recently peaked at over $4.80 per million Btu. Despite past overproduction leading to price collapses, today's scenario presents higher consumer costs, with regulatory decisions allowing utilities to hike electricity prices, as seen in California. Adding to inflationary dynamics, storage levels are lower than the previous year. Strong export demand and growing infrastructure needs, especially with the proliferation of data centers, drive domestic prices up. Policy shifts have led to the approval of new LNG export projects, enhancing export capacity and further influencing the price structure. These factors collectively underscore the complex interplay of domestic and international demand, infrastructure needs, and regulatory impacts driving current natural gas markets."

        "summary": "The article \"Why the Fed Considers 'Pausing or Slowing' QT 'Until the Resolution of the Debt Ceiling Situation'\" from Wolf Street, authored by Wolf Richter, discusses the Federal Reserve's contemplation of adjusting its quantitative tightening (QT) strategy due to the unresolved debt ceiling situation. Lorie Logan, head of the New York Fed\u2019s Markets Group, underscores the potential need for this adjustment, with detailed plans expected at the Fed's March meeting. Since July 2022, the Fed has removed $2.2 trillion from financial markets via QT, but concerns about rapid liquidity withdrawal causing market disruptions, akin to the 2019 repo market incident, have prompted considerations for a pause. Particularly, the debt ceiling fight and the management of an $800-billion federal checking account pose challenges; liquidity enters the market as the balance declines during the debt ceiling period, but risks arise when liquidity is withdrawn quickly as the Treasury refills its account post-resolution. To avoid market instability and significant volatility in money markets, the Fed is weighing a temporary QT slowdown until the debt ceiling is resolved, as discussed in FOMC meeting minutes and speeches by key Fed officials, with further announcements anticipated."

        "summary": "The article \"Federal Government Layoffs & Quits Begin to Show up in the Jobs Data, Barely Dent Solid Labor Market\" by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street discusses the minimal impact of federal government layoffs and resignations on the labor market, which remains robust despite recent reductions in federal employment. This reflects the federal government's employment trends, with a decline of 29,000 jobs in January and February 2025, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Federal employment, historically low at 1.89% of total payrolls, decreased after peaking in May 2024 due to overall payroll growth outpacing federal job growth. The article suggests that wider economic themes would need to impact the labor market significantly. In \"Beyond the federal government,\" total payrolls increased by 151,000 in mid-February, reaching 159.2 million, with job gains averaging 200,000 over three months, rebounding from a 2024 decline. Average hourly earnings grew modestly, with wages increasing by 4.0% year-over-year in February. Unemployment inched up, with 203,000 more job seekers, raising unemployment to 7.05 million and edging the rate to 4.1%, still historically low and outperforming Federal Reserve projections for 2025's end, indicating a robust labor market."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter discusses the Federal Reserve's balance sheet reductions through quantitative tightening (QT), reducing it by $54 billion in February to $6.76 trillion, the lowest since May 2020. This decrease marks a $2.21 trillion reduction from peak levels, which constituted a 25% decrease from the all-time high and a 46% decrease from the asset accumulation due to the pandemic-related quantitative easing (QE). Under the \"QT assets\" section, the Fed significantly reduced its holdings of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities (MBS), having decreased Treasury holdings by $24.3 billion in February with a total reduction of $1.53 trillion from the peak, and its MBS holdings declined by $14.2 billion, with total reductions amounting to $537 billion from peak levels. In \"Bank liquidity facilities: inactive,\" the Fed's liquidity facilities remain largely dormant, showing near-zero balances, indicating reduced necessity following their extensive use post-Silicon Valley Bank's collapse. \"What else caused total assets on the balance sheet to drop?\" notes an additional $16 billion reduction largely due to $14 billion in accrued interest payments being destroyed, thus reducing Fed's assets, alongside the regular monthly reduction in \"unamortized premiums,\" which are now $245 billion, down from $356 billion. Overall, the article highlights the Fed's ongoing efforts and strategies to normalize and unwind their balance sheet following the unprecedented monetary interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article \"Explosion of Imports Causes Trade Deficit to Spike by 96% in January YoY on Tariff Front-Running\" by Wolf Richter examines the dramatic 96% year-over-year increase in the U.S. trade deficit in January, driven by a surge in imports as companies rushed to front-run impending tariffs. The spike, detailed in the section \"Explosion of imports caused Goods & Services trade deficit to spike by 96% YoY,\" reflects a strategic maneuver rather than a decrease in demand, which remains strong, and highlights the distortion this causes in GDP calculations, as imports are subtracted from GDP despite contributing to consumption. The \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET\" section underscores the chaos in tariff announcements, such as the U.S. pause on tariffs for Mexican goods and Canadian and Mexican autos, which has propelled imports to a record $319 billion. This increase is largely driven by finished metal shapes, computers, telecom equipment, and pharmaceutical products, with a notable 1,030% year-over-year rise in finished metal shapes imports. However, motor vehicles and parts imports declined due to their lengthy production lead times. As the article discusses, the U.S.'s dependence on imports due to globalization is concerning, but tariffs may promote domestic manufacturing, with companies like Tesla and Honda already boosting local production. This raises the prospect of a reversal in import trends once the tariff-driven stockpiling ends and pressures companies, potentially including Ford, GM, and Stellantis, to keep prices low for U.S.-made vehicles. The article concludes that the imposition of tariffs could significantly alter the pricing strategies of vehicle manufacturers who are heavily reliant on imports, influencing their production decisions."

The article explores this through various sections. In \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET,\" it discusses the ISM Services PMI report for February, highlighting growth in the US services sector and increased activity in most subindexes, with the Prices Index reaching 62.6%, indicating significant price growth for three consecutive months. In \"But, but, but\u2026 the tariffs haven\u2019t been implemented yet.,\" it notes how companies are preemptively using the anticipated tariffs, which don't yet affect services, to justify price hikes, reminiscent of inflation trends in 2021 and 2022. The \"Can\u2019t pass on those higher prices? What a bummer.\" section highlights challenges some service providers face in transferring increased costs to clients due to competitive pressures, posing risks to profitability despite high input cost inflation. Finally, \"In search of \u201cpricing power,\u201d the holy grail in business.\" emphasizes the lucrative concept of companies raising prices faster than costs, improving profit margins\u2014a feat many achieved through coordinated price hikes in 2021 and 2022, often using unimplemented tariffs as justification. This pattern could trigger a new inflation wave as companies test consumer willingness to accept higher prices, with inflation indicators rising independently of tariff narratives."

        "summary": "The article \"U.S. Demand for Gasoline Faces Long-Term Structural Problem: Plunging Per-Capita Consumption\" from Wolf Street, authored by Wolf Richter, explores the evolving trends in U.S. gasoline consumption. In 2024, gasoline consumption slightly increased but remained below 2004 levels, despite a 16% rise in population over two decades and a 3.9% decline from the 2018 peak. This trend indicates a structural issue in gasoline demand as advancements in fuel efficiency and the growing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), which comprised over 10% of new vehicle sales in 2024, contribute to reduced per-capita gasoline usage. Although the number of miles driven reached a record high for the second consecutive year in 2024, per-person driving slightly decreased from the 2004 peak. The improved fuel economy and rising EV sales significantly impact gasoline consumption, especially in regions like California. Meanwhile, U.S. crude oil production reached record highs, with the country becoming a net exporter and exporting more petroleum products to manage domestic market shifts."

The article highlights the U.S.'s production milestone of 13.3 million barrels per day, a 2.5% increase from 2023, facilitated by fracking, which led to the U.S. becoming the world's largest oil producer by 2018 and a net exporter by 2020. Despite previous challenges during Oil Bust 1 and Oil Bust 2, the industry now focuses on trying to not trigger another oil-price collapse through overproduction and maintains production discipline to avoid financial distress seen in past downturns. Surging exports, falling imports underscores the shift, with exports reaching a remarkable 10.8 MMb/d and imports dropping significantly, highlighting decreased reliance on countries like Saudi Arabia and OPEC, while imports from Canada reached an all-time high. Exports of petroleum products saw substantial growth, making up 62% of total exports, with the Gulf Coast playing a pivotal role in refining and exporting, and hydrocarbon gas liquids also experiencing exemplary growth. However, refilling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve has halted since early February 2024, reflecting strategies to potentially lower crude prices and reduce inflationary pressures."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article written by Wolf Richter explores the concept of \"inflation persistence\" as analyzed by the New York Federal Reserve, which challenges the recent reports that year-over-year Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation has declined. The section \"New York Fed's Measure of 'Inflation Persistence' Nixes Friday's Idea that YoY PCE Inflation Cooled, Using Same Data\" explains that while headline figures may indicate reduced inflation, the pressures have merely shifted from housing to non-housing services and core goods, maintaining overall price pressure across sectors. The \"New York Fed's Measure\" section discusses the introduction of a Multivariate Core Trend (MCT) inflation measure by the New York Fed, aimed at highlighting the persistence of inflation, especially in areas such as \"services ex-housing\" and \"core goods.\" This measure was created when PCE readings were high, positioning inflation as temporary and often showing lower readings compared to core and headline indices. Recent MCT readings, however, point to increasing persistence, diverging from the previous focus on housing. Despite a slight decline in year-over-year PCE inflation noted by the media, acceleration is evident in monthly, three-month, and six-month rates. The section emphasizes the impact of base effects in the services sector, contributing to a subdued year-over-year appearance, with January's headline PCE index showing a decelerated rise of 2.51% and the core index at 2.65%. The MCT's perspective highlights more entrenched inflationary pressures beyond the housing sector, underscoring the complexity and shifting nature of inflation trends, and presenting a dynamic inflation landscape that challenges simplistic interpretations of headline data."

Natural gas prices, despite recent increases, equate to 1996 levels, showcasing a substantial 70% drop from the 2005 peak. In the section by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET, it highlights that the collapse in US natural gas prices since 2008 is linked to fracking and overproduction, worsened by limited export options and high flaring rates in the early 2010s. The section titled \"US Natural Gas Production: Drill, Baby, Drill Since the Early 2000s\" details significant production growth, a 113% increase since 2006, led by the US becoming the world's top natural gas producer, surpassing coal in power generation by 2016, and emerging as the leading LNG exporter by 2023. \"US Natural Gas Exports\" reports a record 7.71 trillion cubic feet of exports in 2024, 18% of US production, with LNG exports at 4.37 trillion cubic feet and pipeline exports increasing to Mexico and decreasing to Canada. Even with rising imports, the US remains a net importer from Canada due to geographical factors. The \"LNG Exports by Region\" section discusses shifting global LNG trade dynamics, with US exports to Europe reduced by 22% from the 2023 peak but still highest, while exports to Asia grew by 33%. Germany, Japan, South Korea, China, and other countries have seen changes in import volumes, reflecting evolving global energy demands and infrastructure developments."

The article suggests that massive seasonal adjustments may have skewed the perception of these statistics. \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET,\" it is noted that the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported a 0.2% decline in consumer spending due to lower goods spending, particularly durable goods like vehicles, which led to media alarm and a sharp drop in the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow projection. The decline in January aligns with typical post-holiday season patterns, with retail sales showing a 16.5% decrease from December due to usual seasonal fluctuations. These fluctuations are usually adjusted for, although they can cause noticeable apparent changes month-to-month but tend to stabilize annually. Even so, year-over-year data remained positive, with retail sales up 4.8%, and vehicle sales performing well. Hence, despite seasonal adjustment distortions, underlying consumer trends indicate stable spending habits."

The \"Inventories balloon in Florida and Texas\" section highlights a 34% year-over-year increase in active listings in Florida and a 25% increase in Texas, indicating significant inventory buildup. The decline in housing demand is primarily attributed to high prices and rising mortgage rates, creating what some describe as a \"buyers' strike.\" February saw a sharp 9.2% decline in the South's pending sales from January, with inventories for new and existing homes at record highs. Across other regions, the Western US had a 1.2% decrease in pending sales, while the Northeast saw a slight increase of 0.3% month-to-month, yet a year-over-year decrease. In the Midwest, pending sales fell 2% month-to-month, maintaining low levels over recent years. Nationwide, new single-family house inventories peaked since 2007, largely driven by the South, with builders offering incentives to combat the struggling market. The overall sluggish housing market is perpetuated by unaffordability challenges impacting both buyers and sellers."

This move comes amidst concerns that revealing total asset data might incite a disorderly bank run if depositors lose confidence in their banks and withdraw funds en masse. Previously, such disclosures provided valuable insight into the scale of financial instability within the banking sector, with a surge in assets signaling larger banks in trouble. Without asset data, the scope of issues is now unclear, as seen in the latest report showing 66 banks on the list as of Q4 2024. Hill states that the non-disclosure aims to prevent speculation and potential bank runs, although Richter suggests that past runs, like the SVB collapse, were linked to the revelation of unrealized losses, not merely asset data. The article raises concerns about the potential future reduction in transparency regarding unrealized losses on bank balance sheets and questions if this might signal a broader shift in regulatory strategy to prevent crises. Wolf Street criticizes the decision, arguing that public disclosure is vital for maintaining accountability and integrity in the financial system, as it theoretically disciplines markets by punishing poor management decisions and preventing reckless behavior by banks."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article explores the Federal Reserve's potential strategy changes for its balance sheet post-quantitative tightening (QT), shifting focus from longer-term securities to short-term instruments such as Treasury bills (T-bills), repos, and loans. Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) will be phased out entirely, contrasting past initiatives like Operation Twist, which transitioned from short to long-term assets. The article highlights a speech by Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, an authority on the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, who suggests that increasing the Fed's holdings of short-term T-bills to align with market ratios could replace the dominance of long-term notes and bonds. This adjustment might lead to higher long-term yields. Logan also emphasizes reducing MBS in favor of Treasury securities, which might widen the mortgage and Treasury yield spread, potentially raising mortgage rates. Additionally, Logan discusses possibly utilizing repos and Discount Window loans as substitutes for some Treasury holdings, although not currently on the FOMC's agenda. She suggests that daily auctioning of Discount Window loans might improve liquidity distribution among banks, noting that any changes would involve thorough discussion and insights from other central banks' practices."

        "summary": "In the article \"Apple Announces Server Manufacturing Plant in Houston, Adding Weight to Eyepopping US Factory Construction Boom\" by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET, Apple\u2019s $500 billion US investment plan aims to boost highly automated domestic manufacturing through the creation of a server plant in Houston, supported by their Advanced Manufacturing Fund. This move, partially a publicity gesture linked to the Trump administration, is fueled by pandemic-induced shifts and US-China tensions, prompting firms to reconsider offshore manufacturing strategies, particularly with policy incentives like the CHIPS Act under the Biden administration. Factory construction, according to the Census Bureau, soared to an unprecedented $233 billion in 2024, reflecting a substantial rise since 2021 and a notable increase in its share of total construction spending. The \"Eyepopping Factory Construction Boom\" results from heightened emphasis on domestic production of advanced technology such as AI servers, semiconductors, and EV components, underscoring a strategic pivot from Chinese manufacturing dependency amid geopolitical risks. With costs of industrial robots neutralizing manual labor advantages overseas, US manufacturing regains importance, enhancing economic security and reducing supply chain vulnerabilities, as detailed in \"The Rethink About Manufacturing in the US is Real.\" This indicates a proactive shift across administrations, leveraging different strategies like tariffs or subsidies to invigorate local economies and innovate future manufacturing."

Here\u2019s Why You Might Get Blocked and What You Can Do if You Get Blocked,\" Wolf Richter highlights the potential issue of being blocked on Wolf Street when using a VPN. This occurs because VPNs often assign IP addresses previously used by spammers, leading to blockages even for legitimate users due to the site's anti-spam measures. In the section \"VPNs are beneficial,\" Richter explains how VPNs mask users' locations but cannot prevent VPN providers from accessing non-encrypted data. Wolf Street combats spam from specific regions such as Pakistan and Russia by blocking associated IPs, thereby affecting VPN users who may inadvertently connect from those places. The section \"How do you know if you\u2019re blocked?\" describes symptoms of IP blockade, like a blank page with \"Wordfence\" and instructions to contact the administrator. In \"What to do if you get blocked at the IP address,\" users are advised to change VPN locations, preferably to a US city, or disable the VPN to regain access, as corporate VPNs handle IP rotation better than cheaper services. Lastly, \"If you don\u2019t use a VPN but get blocked\u2026\" suggests contacting Wolf Street via public or business email, especially for subscribers, while also considering donations to support the publication."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter explores several sections detailing the current state of the Treasury yield curve and its broader implications. In the section \"So how to get the 10-year yield to go down?\" Richter articulates a three-pronged strategy needed to lower the 10-year Treasury yield: a more hawkish Federal Reserve pausing rate cuts to combat rising rates, the Treasury Department shifting to short-term issuance and targeting deficit reduction, and both institutions effectively communicating to manage expectations. The article notes in \"Short-term yields stayed put\" that since early December, short-term yields have remained stable near the Effective Federal Funds Rate (EFFR), reflecting a steady interest rate environment without anticipated cuts before mid-2025. In \"The yield curve flattened,\" the article illustrates how the Federal Reserve\u2019s halt of rate cuts kept short-term yields stable while slight decreases in long-term yields resulted in a flattening yield curve, with an unusual pattern seen in the dip of the one-year yield. Despite these developments, the article's section \"But mortgage rates remain close to 7%\" highlights that mortgage rates have persistently hovered around 7%, with a high reached at 7.04% despite the Fed reducing rates by 100 basis points. With the recent drop in the 10-year Treasury yield to 4.43%, investors seek safety amid declining stock markets, but a disconnect persists between treasury yields and the Fed's policy due to market expectations that the Fed won't tackle inflation aggressively. The article underscores the importance of the 10-year yield as a determinant for economic conditions, indicating that sustained inflation impacts and anticipated future rate cuts have led investors to seek higher returns over the next decade, raising long-term yields as covered in the opening segment \"Treasury Yield Curve Flattens as 10-Year Yield Falls, Short-Term Yields Stay Put: Fed\u2019s Pivot to Wait-and-See in Inflationary Times.\""

This \"Buyers Strike\" has resulted in increased active listings and longer market durations, indicating a market correction as buyers await better conditions. The National Association of Realtors reported a 4.9% decline in home sales in January compared to December, only marginally above last year's low. \"Demand Destruction by Region\" reveals regional variations, with declines in the Northeastern and Southern US, stability in the Midwest, and increased demand in the West. \"Highest Supply Since January 2019\" notes a rise in unsold home supply to 3.5 months, the highest since 2019. Despite a doubling in \"Active Listings Since 2021\" to 829,400, January's sales fell 31% year-over-year, highlighting a market imbalance. \"Days on Market Lengthen to 73 Days\" notes longer sale durations, reflecting seller motivation versus sale speed. The article critiques the \"median price\" metric for its seasonal bias and suggests a more comprehensive approach, revealing market disparities like Austin's drop and New York's gain from 2022 peaks. The national median price for homes decreased in January, following seasonal trends but with a year-over-year rise attributed to the Federal Reserve's interest-rate policies. Condo and co-op prices dropped 2.9% in January, marking the largest December-January decrease since 2015."

BOJ Babied its Rate to Just 0.5%, with More Baby Hikes in View,\" written by Wolf Richter, it's highlighted that Japan's inflation has surged to 4.0%, surpassing the rate in the US. This rise, particularly in January, with a Consumer Price Index (CPI) hitting 4.02% year-over-year and even reaching 4.6% excluding imputed rent, has been driven by increased costs in food and energy. Fresh food prices alone jumped by 7.8%, with significant spikes in vegetables and seaweeds, while energy prices rose by 10.8% year-over-year, straining Japanese households significantly as they spend a substantial portion of their income on these essentials. The Bank of Japan (BOJ), led by its strategic low-interest rate of 0.5% with potential gradual increases, aims to manage Japan's towering debt-to-GDP ratio of 254% projected for 2024, attempting to devalue its debt while dealing with rising household costs and lower investment yields. This approach demonstrates the BOJ's challenge in meeting its 2% inflation target amidst these pressures, as the core CPI, excluding fresh food, reached 3.2%, and 2.6% when excluding both fresh food and energy. The debt-to-GDP ratio is improving at the cost of Japanese citizens facing higher living expenses, showing that there are indeed no 'free lunches' in this economic strategy."

In \"Delinquency rates for credit cards that are 30 days or more past due,\" the article highlights the Federal Reserve's findings that delinquency rates have decreased for two consecutive quarters, mirroring pre-pandemic levels due to initial stabilizing effects of government aid and increased consumer spending following the pandemic. In \"Credit Card Balances are a measure of spending, not of debt,\" credit card balances are depicted primarily as spending indicators rather than debt, with high-income earners leveraging larger credit limits to accumulate rewards, while only a smaller proportion remains as revolving debt. \"More people, more workers, making more, spending more\" details the $45 billion increase in credit card statement balances by the end of Q4, linked to holiday expenditure and a consequential year-over-year growth of 7.3%, reflecting higher consumer earnings. The \"credit-balance-to-income ratio\" section illustrates how the debt-to-disposable-income ratio reflects household debt burden amidst a 144% surge in disposable income over two decades, coupled with a 58% rise in credit and consumer loan balances, with seasonal spending affecting quarterly ratios but remaining low historically. Lastly, \"Banks eager to lend at high rates and earn swipe fees\" elaborates on banks benefiting from high interest rates and transaction fees, with available unused credit reaching a record $3.87 trillion as banks enthusiastically issue new and higher-limit credit accounts. Together, these dynamics underscore the complex landscape of consumer confidence and potential financial risks with elevated credit reliance."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article titled \"The Collapse of the EV SPACs: Nikola Joins EV SPAC Bankruptcy Lineup. Here Are Those Already Bankrupt, and Those Not Yet\" by Wolf Richter, explores the turmoil in the electric vehicle sector attributed to the decline of Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs). The introduction highlights the initial surge and subsequent financial struggles faced by these SPAC-backed EV companies, with Nikola's bankruptcy acting as the latest addition to these failures. In the section \"Nikola's Chapter 11 Filing,\" Nikola's collapse is detailed, emphasizing its financial mismanagement, the incarceration of ex-CEO Trevor Milton for fraud, and the inability to generate significant revenue despite a past valuation of over $28 billion. The section \"EV SPACs that are no longer twitching\" lists several SPAC-backed EV ventures like Electric Last Mile Solutions, Proterra, Lordstown Motors, and Fisker, all succumbing to financial collapse post-SPAC merger. Other failed companies include Lion Electric and Canoo, both filing for bankruptcy after unsuccessful market entries. Conversely, \"EV SPACs that are still twitching\" covers firms like Faraday Future, Mullen Automotive, VinFast Auto, Lucid Motors, and Polestar, which remain operational but struggling financially. Lucid Motors, though suffering significant losses, still produces high-end electric vehicles with aid from Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund. Rivian is an exception, having gone public through a traditional IPO and maintaining operations with support from Amazon and Volkswagen, although its share value has declined from its peak. The overall theme reflects the severe challenges faced by SPAC-backed EVs, emphasizing cautionary tales of speculative enthusiasm and financial mismanagement."

In the \"Auto Debts\" section, Richter explains that despite an increase in vehicle sales, growth in auto loans has been modest due to a rise in cash purchases influenced by higher interest rates. The article points out that the auto-loan-to-income ratio has declined, indicating a reduced burden of auto debt on households, as discussed in the \"Auto-Loan-to-Income Ratio\" section. This decrease stems from disposable income growing at a faster rate than auto-loan balances, suggesting a moderation in consumer spending on auto loans. In the section \"Serious delinquency rates: total, subprime, and prime,\" Richter notes that the overall delinquency rate for auto loans and leases rose slightly to 1.58% in December 2024, with subprime loans showing a delinquency rate of 6.15%. Despite this, prime-rated auto loans face minimal delinquency due to their borrowers' financial stability. The article likens American consumers to \"drunken sailors\" because of their debt accumulation and financial challenges, a theme consistent across discussions on consumer credit, highlighting the urgency for better financial management.

It highlights how 21 major metropolitan markets in the US, including Austin, San Francisco, and Phoenix, have experienced property price declines below their 2022 peak levels, signaling a downturn from the pandemic-fueled boom due to factors like rising interest rates and shifting demand. Conversely, areas like Miami, San Diego, and Los Angeles are showing signs of slowing growth, while cities such as Baltimore, Kansas City, and Columbus continue to see stable growth, revealing regional disparities.

Twenty-one metros, including Austin, San Francisco, Phoenix, and San Antonio, have seen a decline in housing prices from their 2022 peaks and have not fully recovered. Meanwhile, cities like Miami, San Diego, and Los Angeles initially exceeded 2022 price levels but are now experiencing reductions, indicating a shift in resilience. In contrast, Baltimore, Kansas City, and Washington D.C. have surpassed their 2022 prices without significant downturns, demonstrating resilience amidst broader economic influences. The other section, titled \"Home prices in January,\" details that prices fell across 32 large metros, excluding San Jose, where values stabilized for the fifth month. This variability is due to seasonal influences and the impact of the Federal Reserve's quantitative tightening, causing increased mortgage rates.

Reflecting a shift in financial strategy, households increasingly tap into home equity, with HELOC balances seeing a notable increase of 2.3% quarter-on-quarter and 10% year-over-year, unlike new mortgages which saw a marginal $15 billion growth due to low existing home sales. Nearly half of recent HELOCs have limits between $50,000 and $150,000, a trend favoring HELOCs over cash-out refinancing to leverage existing low mortgage rates. The \"But here come the HELOCs\" section details this shift from cash-out refinancing, driven by higher mortgage rates, enabling borrowers to draw smaller amounts with interest only on used balances. The \"Burden of housing debt: Debt-to-Income Ratio\" section indicates that the housing debt-to-income ratio has decreased to a record low of 59.1% in Q4 2024, due to rising household incomes and stable housing debt, while mortgage rates remain predominantly low due to fixed rates that shield homeowners from financial turmoil. However, in cases of mortgage defaults, the risk is largely borne by investors and taxpayers because most residential mortgages are bundled into government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities. The concluding section, \"So far, so good,\" emphasizes the historical low in mortgage delinquencies at 0.70% and foreclosures, which remain subdued due to pandemic-related programs. Strong home price growth enables homeowners to sell properties above the owed amount, preventing delinquencies and preserving credit scores. Overall, the article articulates a landscape where household income growth and cautious financial behavior support housing stability despite the challenges."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article \"About that Retail Sales Plunge in the Headlines: A Romp through the Massive Seasonal Adjustments this Time of the Year\" by Wolf Richter delves into the intricacies of retail sales data and the effects of seasonal adjustments, particularly focusing on January's figures. The section titled \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET\" explains that although headlines reported a plunge in month-on-month retail sales due to a 0.9% decline after adjustment, actual sales increased by 4.8% year-over-year, evidencing the impact of seasonal trends. Richter emphasizes that although non-seasonally adjusted sales fell by 16.5% month-over-month, this fluctuation is normal given historical January sales declines ranging from 15% to 22%. The following section, \"Seasonal adjustments at the Big Three,\" illustrates how various retail sectors, such as auto and parts dealers, nonstore retailers, and food services, experience distinct seasonal patterns. For instance, auto dealers see their lowest sales in January, nonstore retailers drop sharply after December holidays, and food services record lower sales during winter months. Despite such declines, year-over-year sales for these categories grew, showcasing robust consumer activity. Finally, in \"So what does this mean?\", Richter concludes that the 4.8% year-over-year rise in January's retail sales does not indicate any significant change in consumer behavior, as fluctuations are expected and typically do not reflect broader economic trends. The article argues that examining year-over-year figures rather than month-to-month changes provides a clearer picture of retail sales trends, attributing discrepancies in data interpretation to extensive seasonal adjustments like those made using the Census Bureau\u2019s X-13 ARIMA-SEATS program."

Despite the rise, debt is growing at a slower pace compared to income, resulting in a decrease in the debt burden relative to income and a debt-to-income ratio of 82.0% in the fourth quarter, the lowest since 2003. Subprime borrowers remain economically challenged, but the overall scenario shows improved consumer balance sheets, with many households owning assets and managing their debts effectively, even as higher interest rates persist. The article highlights how the end of the Free-Money period and mortgage-forbearance programs contributed to reduced delinquency, foreclosures, and bankruptcy rates, despite a slight increase in serious delinquencies to 2%, still lower than the 3% during 2018-2019. Meanwhile, third-party collections stay at historic lows of around 4.6%, with bankruptcy filings dipping significantly. This stability suggests a possible shift in household debt trends, with further insights on housing, credit card, and auto debt expected in subsequent articles."

Wolf Richter explains that January's PPI rose 3.51% year-over-year, the highest since February 2023, following December revisions from 3.31% to 3.48% due to service inflation revisions. Month-to-month PPI for final demand increased by 0.40% in January, with December inputs revised from 0.22% to 0.50%, causing a six-month PPI surge to 4.0% annualized, the highest since October 2022. Energy prices increased 1.7% in January, and food prices also rose. Core PPI, excluding food and energy, rose 0.28% in January after December revisions, reaching a six-month 3.8% annualized high. Year-over-year core PPI for December was revised up to 3.75% from 3.55%, with January at 3.61%. The services PPI was significantly revised in December and rose in January, making a six-month services PPI increase of 4.5% annualized. Core goods PPI remained stable with a 2.0% year-over-year increase, underscoring service inflationary pressures and rising consumer price inflation."

        "summary": "The article by Wolf Richter on Wolf Street discusses the acceleration of the Producer Price Index (PPI) inflation to 3.5% year over year, which marks the worst increase in two years, primarily driven by the services sector that constitutes two-thirds of the overall PPI. This is highlighted in the section titled \"PPI Inflation Accelerates to +3.5% yoy, Worst in 2 Years, Driven by Services amid Massive Up-Revisions in Services,\" where it is noted that services have seen significant cost pressures leading to upward revisions in prices. In the following section, \"By [Wolf Richter] for [WOLF STREET],\" it is detailed how massive upwards revisions for December, particularly in services, contributed to the noticeable increase in the PPI for January with a month-to-month rise of 0.40% after December's revised increase of 0.50%. Despite declining energy prices since mid-2022, recent increases potentially mask the inflation impacts within services sectors, and food prices rose by 1.1% in January, partially due to avian flu affecting egg production. The article also discusses the \"core\" PPI, excluding food and energy, which experienced significant revisions for December, contributing to an accelerated six-month annualized PPI growth to 3.8% in January, the steepest since September. While core year-over-year PPI growth slightly decelerated from December to January 2025, non-housing services showed a sharp acceleration aligning with PPI trends, underscoring inflation concerns primarily in services, as reflected in consumer price inflation tracked by the CPI."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article \"Beneath the Skin of CPI Inflation\" by Wolf Richter provides a comprehensive analysis of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and its significant components. In the \"CPI Inflation\" section, it highlights that October and January faced notable month-to-month inflation spikes due to increased costs in used vehicles, non-housing services, food, and energy. January's CPI rose 0.47% from December, led by durable goods prices, notably used vehicles, and non-housing services such as auto insurance and subscriptions. The \"Major Components\" section details year-over-year increases, with overall CPI up 3.0%, core CPI excluding volatile items like food and energy up 3.26%, and Core Services CPI experiencing sharp increases driven by core services and used vehicle prices. In \"Core Services,\" the article discusses how costs like motor vehicle maintenance and repair surged by 6.2% annualized in January, while insurance costs rose 26.7% annualized. \"Prices of Goods\" focus on used vehicles, which saw a 2.2% monthly rise in January, reversing previous declines and contributing to overall inflation. The \"Food Inflation\" section reports a 5.7% annualized increase in food prices for home consumption in January, the most significant rise since October 2022, driven by spikes in egg and other categories. \"Apparel and Footwear\" describes a 1.4% monthly decline in January, contributing to a subdued year-over-year rise, indicating moderation in pricing pressures. Finally, \"Energy\" explores the 1.8% increase in gasoline prices from December, nearly ending the year-over-year decline, while broader energy CPI, including various energy products, rose 1.1% from the previous month with categories like natural gas and heating oil exhibiting varying price changes. Overall, the article illustrates persistent inflationary pressures with significant shifts across services, goods, food, apparel, and energy sectors."

        "summary": "The article \"Treasury Market\u2019s Inflation Expectations Become 'Unanchored'\" by Wolf Richter on WOLF STREET explores the Federal Reserve's transition from cutting interest rates to a wait-and-see approach due to rising concerns over long-term interest rates and the increasing unpredictability, or \"unanchoring,\" of inflation expectations in the Treasury market. In the section by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET, it is highlighted that Fed Chair Jerome Powell, in his Senate testimony, insisted that longer-term inflation expectations remain \"well anchored\" according to surveys and financial market measures. Nonetheless, the bond market, which significantly influences Treasury trading, is showing signs of apprehension regarding inflation, as evidenced by the 5-year breakeven inflation rate reaching new highs, suggesting the growth in inflation expectations. This upward trend in inflation expectations has prompted the Fed to adopt a cautious wait-and-see approach, aiming to avoid further disturbing the bond market by refraining from additional rate cuts, despite existing pressures. The Fed's strategy is mainly to control inflation to ensure stability through moderate long-term interest rates, consistent with its mandate of achieving maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The current bias leans towards rate cuts rather than hikes unless there is a marked acceleration in inflation, which could necessitate rate hikes to mitigate bond market instability and rising long-term yields."

        "summary": "In the article \"There Hasn\u2019t Been Much if Any Reduction in WFH in over Two Years, Despite the Hype about RTO\" by Wolf Richter on Wolf Street, it is highlighted that despite the media's focus on Return-to-Office (RTO) mandates, companies continue to embrace remote work with minimal changes in office attendance over the past two years. In the section \"Office attendance has barely ticked up in two years,\" data from Kastle's back-to-work barometer reveals that office occupancy is struggling to reach pre-COVID levels, with attendance in major markets averaging just 54% compared to pre-pandemic numbers, and dramatic dips on certain days of the week, notably Fridays. Furthermore, \"No decline in the share of WFH in 2023-2025\" discusses that despite hospitality and service employees returning to on-site roles, by January 2025 over 29% of full paid working days were from home, significantly higher than the 2019 level of 7%. By late 2024, 39% of full-time employees engaged in some form of remote work, highlighting its embedded place in workplace dynamics. Lastly, in \"Hopes that RTO will bail out the office sector seem premature,\" the article argues that many firms, such as Google and Apple, and even smaller businesses, have integrated hybrid work models, while others like Nvidia and Airbnb have no RTO mandates, instead building on remote work's benefits. These ongoing trends caution against expecting traditional office sectors to fully rebound to pre-pandemic occupancy, indicating that hopes tied to RTO saving the office sector are overly optimistic."

Inflationary pressures are building, as shown by a 0.4% increase in auction prices in January according to Manheim's Used Vehicle Value Index, with tax-refund season expected to further increase demand. There is a spotlight on price increases by power train, with used electric vehicles (EVs) experiencing a 2.1% rise from December to January, while used vehicles with internal combustion engines (ICE) saw a more modest increase. The inventory issue highlights ongoing supply challenges, with retail inventories down 5% from the previous year and 25% from 2019 due to past semiconductor shortages and reduced leasing activity. Retail prices U-turned as the used vehicle CPI showed a 1.2% increase in December, marking a reversal from previous declines in retail prices that had previously eased CPI inflation. These dynamics illustrate the complex interplay of supply, demand, and economic indicators in the used vehicle market."

In the section \"The Federal Reserve has expressed concerns about the labor market data previously missing the impact of immigrants,\" it highlights that the Federal Reserve has been concerned about the labor market data not reflecting the immigrant workforce. With the Census Bureau's revised population estimate, which included eight million recent immigrants, the Bureau of Labor Statistics made a substantial upward adjustment to employment and the labor force, as explained in the section \"The newly released annual revisions show a significant upward adjustment to employment and the labor force, incorporating a wave of immigrants.\" This adjustment led to a reported decrease in unemployment and accelerated wage growth, providing the Fed with evidence to maintain its current economic stance. The section \"The Wolf Street article explores how recent immigration has impacted employment data in the U.S.\" emphasizes the Census Bureau\u2019s inclusion of recent immigrants, prompting a considerable adjustment in household survey data, leading to an increase of 2.23 million in employment and a 2.20 million increase in the labor force for January. Nonfarm payrolls showed a smaller increase, underscoring a disparity between employment measures, as seen in \"Nonfarm payrolls showed a smaller increase, highlighting a disparity between different measures of employment.\" The unemployment rate fell to 4.0%, and yet there was a robust job growth and a notable increase in average hourly earnings despite revisions showing lower job creation in past years, as mentioned in \"Additionally, the article discusses revisions to nonfarm payrolls data, which showed lower job creation in previous years than initially reported.\" The Fed, having concerns over delays in immigration data inclusion, as expressed in the section \"The Federal Reserve has expressed concerns over the delay in incorporating immigration data into labor statistics,\" now gains a clearer view of the labor market for monetary policy consideration thanks to these revisions."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter discusses the Federal Reserve's efforts to reduce its balance sheet through Quantitative Tightening (QT), with a notable reduction of $42 billion in January, bringing the overall balance down to $6.81 trillion, the lowest since May 2020. Since the end of Quantitative Easing (QE) in April 2022, the Fed has shed $2.15 trillion, or 24% of its total assets, reversing approximately 45% of the expansion seen during the pandemic. The article details QT assets by category, reporting a $25.2 billion reduction in Treasury securities in January, totaling a 46% decline since peak pandemic levels, with holdings now at $4.27 trillion. The Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) holdings saw a $15.7 billion reduction, marking a 19.1% decrease since April 2022 and a 38% decrease since peak pandemic levels. Due to limited mortgage activity, MBS reduction ranges between $15-17 billion monthly. The section on bank liquidity facilities highlights a decline in balances across five Fed facilities, including the expiration and significant drop in the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) launched in March 2023 due to bank arbitrage activities. The Discount Window's balance also decreased to $3.1 billion in January from a March peak of $153 billion during a banking panic. Despite Fred Chair Powell's urging for banks to use it more, the stigma and 4.5% interest rate limit its use. This overall QT effort aims to normalize the monetary policy landscape post-pandemic."

        "summary": "The article titled \"The Fed\u2019s QT Could Go on for a Lot Longer: The Tools Are in Place, incl. the Revived Standing Repo Facility\" by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street discusses the Federal Reserve's continued efforts in Quantitative Tightening (QT) and the tools supporting this process. QT has significantly reduced the volume of Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreements (ON RRPs) to below $80 billion, a dramatic decline from the $2.4 trillion peak in December 2022, bringing them near-zero levels reminiscent of pre-2008 financial conditions. Despite this reduction, reserve balances have remained stable at approximately $3.18 trillion since July 2022, indicating QT's primary goal of decreasing excess liquidity in the banking system hasn't been fully achieved. The Federal Reserve had lowered its ON RRP offering rate as a QT strategy, but this yielded minimal impact on reserve balances, with the further duration of QT likely hinging more on reserves than ON RRPs. Historical context highlights that, prior to 2008's Quantitative Easing, banks maintained near-zero excess reserves by utilizing the Federal Reserve's Standing Repo Facility (SRF) for managing liquidity. Anticipating QT needs, the Fed has revived the SRF to manage daily liquidity requirements, enabling banks to lend in the repo market to stabilize rates. This preparation helps avert market disruptions, such as the repo market turmoil of September 2019, and facilitates a gradual reduction of reserves. The Fed's robust tools, particularly the SRF, suggest that QT could feasibly continue for a longer duration without market disturbances."

The \"Trade Deficit in Goods Worsens to All-Time Worst in 2024, Small Surplus in Services Rises, Overall Trade Deficit Worsens by 17%\" section highlights how the trade deficit in goods has reached a record high, mainly due to strategic moves by countries like Vietnam and Ireland that help companies bypass US tariffs and taxes. Despite a small increase in the services surplus, the overall deficit has worsened by 17%, reflecting corporate America's maneuvering to navigate trade and tax policies. The subsequent section, represented by Richter's name, provides further analysis on how the total trade deficit, which has risen to $918 billion, continues to hurt GDP and underscores the negative effects of globalization, which has marginalized US manufacturing. The article details how China's share of global manufacturing, at 31.6%, dwarfs that of the US, influencing employment and economic conditions negatively. Regarding trade specifics with China, a 7% deterioration is noted but is potentially understated due to rerouted goods through other countries. \"The US goods trade deficit, by country/region\" section discusses the role of third-country transshipments and tax avoidance strategies that elevate trade deficits. For example, trade deficits with Vietnam and Mexico rose significantly, and the deficit with Ireland surged 38% due to tax strategies, even surpassing Germany and Japan. Finally, the \"The 15 trade partners with which the US has the worst goods trade deficits\" section centers on the impact of tariffs on the economy, noting their effect on importers and stock performance, and hints at a forthcoming detailed analysis of US imports and exports by category.

The article describes a low point in September that worried the Federal Reserve (the Fed) due to potential impacts on economic stability, but this concern has since diminished as the job market regains strength and inflation accelerates. Consequently, the Fed is more cautious about implementing rate cuts, indicating that such measures are postponed for now. In \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET,\" Richter analyzes whether pressure exists on the Fed to cut interest rates. He concludes there is no such pressure, as the labor market has slightly tightened with increasing inflation, supported by President Trump\u2019s agreement on a wait-and-see approach. In \"Recent data shows job openings,\" the article examines a minor decrease in job openings from previous months, though they remain high relative to pre-pandemic levels. The high number of job openings per unemployed person marks a tight labor market akin to conditions seen in 2018 and 2019, along with a rise in voluntary job quits indicating increased confidence among employees. Lastly, under \"Job hires rose in December,\" it is noted that hires have increased while layoffs and discharges are at historically low levels comparable to pre-pandemic times. This indicates a stabilized labor market where employers retain their workforce amidst tight conditions, reflecting an ongoing churn of job openings and hires."

This temporary alignment follows previous tensions where Trump had criticized and pressured the Fed for its monetary policy decisions, particularly its interest rate hikes. The article emphasizes Trump's nuanced understanding of Americans' concerns about inflation and his current approval of the Fed's decision to maintain interest rates, reflecting his awareness of the Fed's role in price stability. Nonetheless, there is skepticism about how long this harmony will last, considering Trump's history of vocal demands for policy changes. The Federal Reserve is also making adjustments to align with the Trump administration's preferences, such as reviewing bank stress tests, withdrawing from the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), and planning a review of bank regulations. These shifts suggest the Fed's attempt to maintain its long-term autonomy while accommodating political pressures to some degree. Trump's recognition of inflation as a critical issue grants the Fed some leeway to manage it without immediate political interference, but challenges to the Fed's independence remain a concern."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter examines the effects of tariffs imposed during President Trump's administration between 2018 and 2019. Despite expectations of inflation resulting from increased costs for companies, the section \"Inflation did not accelerate\" reports that inflation did not accelerate; the core PCE price index remained below the 2% target, with durable goods experiencing essentially zero inflation as companies struggled to pass on costs to consumers. The section \"Customs duties more than doubled in less than two years\" notes customs duties more than doubled, from under $40 billion to an annual rate of $80 billion by Q3 2019 and reached nearly $110 billion by Q2 2022, demonstrating that while tariffs did not trigger inflation, they significantly increased government revenue. The article explains in \"Some basics about tariffs\" that tariffs are used to boost government revenue and influence domestic production dynamics, potentially leading foreign manufacturers to shift production to the U.S. to avoid tariffs. Although these tariffs benefitted the U.S. economy by promoting domestic production, they negatively impacted stock markets, as outlined in \"What Trump's Tariffs Did Last Time (2018-2019): No Impact on Inflation, Doubled Receipts from Customs Duties, and Hit Stocks,\" causing uncertainty and a decline in investor confidence, with the S&P 500 declining by 20% that year. Despite this, overvaluation presents a greater threat to the stock market than tariffs according to the article. Overall, the tariffs doubled customs receipts but did not cause the feared inflation and had a mixed impact on the economy and stock markets."

PCE Price Index Accelerates for 3rd Month: Justifies Fed\u2019s Pivot to Wait-and-See\" discusses the persistent inflation in core services, unchanged over eight months, and the acceleration of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index for three consecutive months. This situation upholds the Federal Reserve's wait-and-see stance on interest rates, as traditional methods have fallen short in achieving the desired inflation decrease. Since mid-2022, energy and durable goods prices fell, stabilizing inflation, but now these prices have stopped declining, while service inflation remains high since mid-2024, fueling overall inflation indices like the PCE price index. Even as durable goods prices showed no year-over-year change due to prior cooling, and now stabilize, they continue to pressure inflation, being pivotal in economic evaluations. The PCE price index and core PCE price index have risen above the Fed's 2% target, with core services significantly influencing persistent inflation. Under \"Month-to-month and six-month\", it is revealed that December saw a notable increase in the PCE price index by 0.26%, or 3.1% annually, and the core PCE price index rose by 0.16%, maintaining a 2.3% annual rate. Core services rose by 0.29% or 3.5% annually, unaffected for a year, with housing costs increasing to a 4.3% annualized rate. Food inflation, which had calmed after a 2022 spike, now starts to rise, with a 0.24% increase in December as the steepest in over a year. Energy prices sharply increased by 38% annually in December, the highest since August 2022, despite a slight year-over-year decrease, posing volatility challenges. The prior drop in energy prices that eased the PCE index may now wane with the recent rise."

        "summary": "The article \"Buyers\u2019 Strike Continues: Pending Home Sales Drop Again while Inventories of New & Existing Homes Balloon, Especially in the South & West\" by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street discusses the current housing market scenario marked by a \"buyers' strike,\" largely due to unaffordable high home prices despite price declines in certain cities. The \"Buyers' Strike continued because prices are too high.\" section explains how potential buyers are deterred by high prices, with pending home sales and mortgage applications significantly declining. Even as home prices in cities like Austin, San Francisco, and New York City have dropped between 9% and over 20%, affordability concerns persist, keeping potential buyers hesitant. The \"Mortgage rates are back in the old-normal range.\" section informs that mortgage rates have normalized to pre-quantitative easing levels, stabilizing at an average of 6.95%, as the Federal Reserve has ceased its practice of purchasing mortgage-backed securities. Meanwhile, the \"Inventory of existing homes & new construction is piling up, particularly in the South and West.\" section reports an increase in the national supply of existing homes, notably in the South and West, with new completed house inventory reaching the highest levels since 2009. In the \"Buyers' Strike continued because prices are too high.\" section, it highlights the decline in pending home sales alongside high prices, freezing the resale market and affecting the brokerage and mortgage industries. The real estate industry\u2019s hopes for a recovery in existing home sales are dim as pending home sales fell significantly in December, reflecting a sustained decline over the years. The article suggests that the ongoing \"buyers' strike\" and high prices are causing a market slowdown with affordability remaining a significant concern."

Debt-to-GDP Ratio Worsened to 121.8%,\" Wolf Richter explains the economic dynamics of the fourth quarter with a surge in consumer spending, marking the largest increase in nearly two years. This surge, particularly in motor vehicles and recreational goods, spurred a 4.2% annualized growth in consumer spending, contributing to a 2.3% rise in real GDP despite downturns in private domestic investment and inventory changes. The annual real GDP growth for 2024 was 2.8%, surpassing the 15-year average, driven largely by consumer activity, which matched this growth rate. The \"final sales to private domestic purchasers\" metric rose 3.2% annually, reflecting robust domestic demand. Despite these positives, the debt-to-GDP ratio deteriorated to 121.8% by the fourth quarter due to increased national debts juxtaposed with modest GDP growth in current dollars, influenced by historical spending spikes and the 2020 lockdown's economic impact. Additionally, the trade deficit remained near-record levels as exports dipped slightly, but imports positively impacted GDP growth."

In the section by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street, Powell explained during a press conference that patience is crucial, as the current monetary policy is less restrictive due to the economy's continued resilience. He highlighted the importance of reaching the Fed's 2% inflation target while avoiding adverse effects on the labor market. Powell assured that while the policy remains restrictive enough to aim for the inflation goal, more advancements are necessary. He dismissed setting a timeline for concluding Quantitative Tightening (QT), noting that reserves are still \"abundant\" but assured that the Fed keeps a close watch on when reserves might become scarce. Powell commented on high stock market valuations and potential financial stability impacts but affirmed that financial resilience remains robust, with strong bank capital and household finances. With the administration's incoming policies, he emphasized a \"wait-and-see\" stance, indicating the Fed will adapt its position once policies are clearly defined and understood."

QT Continues.\" by Wolf Richter on Wolf Street discusses the Federal Reserve's decision to maintain interest rates within the range of 4.25% to 4.50%, marking a shift to a \"wait-and-see\" approach following previous hikes. This decision aligns with forecasts despite rising inflation concerns indicated by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the stable labor market, which has not provided justification for further rate cuts. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) chose to keep policy rates and interest on reserves unchanged and continues to implement Quantitative Tightening (QT) as per its schedule. However, the meeting did not include a new Summary of Economic Projections, which will next be updated in March. The statement from the FOMC highlights continued robust economic activity, low unemployment, and strong labor market conditions, with inflation remaining slightly elevated. The Committee aims for a 2% long-term inflation rate and maximum employment while considering potential risks to these goals balanced. As such, the target range for federal funds is kept between 4.25% and 4.50%, and ongoing monitoring of economic indicators such as labor market conditions, inflation trends, and global financial situations will influence future policy decisions. The Committee remains prepared to adjust policies if risks to employment and inflation goals arise, emphasizing thorough evaluations of new data and developments."

        "summary": "In the article \"Glut of New Houses for Sale in the South Is Bigger Even than during the Housing Bust. The Glut in the West Gets Close\" by Wolf Richter on Wolf Street, it is highlighted that the southern U.S. is facing an overwhelming supply of newly constructed houses, exceeding even the levels observed during the housing downturn of 2007. As of December, this inventory has surged by 76% since December 2019, totaling 301,000 homes, resulting in a 10-month supply range despite homebuilders offering incentives up to 10% of the sales price. Similarly, the Western U.S. is experiencing a parallel trend with inventory levels reaching the highest point since December 2007, reflecting a 35% increase since 2019 and an 11.3-month supply, leading to sluggish sales despite high prices. In his section \"The housing market in the Southern U.S.,\" Richter describes how sales in the South have dipped slightly from the previous year, with homebuilders using incentives to maintain activity amid the oversupply. In the West, as mentioned in his section \"In the Western U.S.,\" supply has reached significant levels due to tepid sales and high prices. The article also touches on \"The other two regions are not big players in the single-family market,\" where the Northeast and Midwest are not significant influencers in the U.S. single-family housing market due to a focus on multifamily projects which enhance urban density, with the Northeast seeing only 33,000 new houses sold in 2024, leading to a 17-month supply, and the Midwest experiencing increased inventory levels, leading to the highest figures since 2009. These regional dynamics highlight an imbalance in the national housing market, with high levels of inventory and stagnant sales, hinting at a potential market correction through price reductions or shifts in market conditions."

According to Wolf Richter's analysis for Wolf Street, \"Stimulate demand with lower prices, bigger incentives, smaller houses\" captures how big homebuilders, like D.R. Horton, tackle market conditions by offering large incentives to attract buyers. These strategies, including mortgage rate buydowns reaching up to 10% of selling prices in markets like Florida and Texas, are crucial despite affecting profit margins. However, \"But incentives are not reflected in the \u201cContract Price\u201d of the house,\" highlighting that while contract prices have dropped since their 2022 peak, they do not reflect these incentives, underlining the increased costs homebuilders incur. The \"Sales have been solid thanks to reduced prices & higher incentives\" section indicates that new home sales rose 12% year-over-year in December, contrasting with falling existing home sales. Overall, the inventory of unsold new homes rose significantly, challenging the \"housing shortage\" notion, with existing home sales plunging to 1995 levels due to extreme price hikes. While the surge in complete new homes offers market stabilization potential, the housing supply reaching 9.4 months suggests further price cuts could balance supply and demand."

        "summary": "The article \"DOGE Seeks to Shed Vast Amounts of Government Office Space\" by Wolf Richter on Wolf Street examines the government's initiative to significantly reduce its office space footprint, a trend that started during Donald Trump's presidency. The \"What office landlords and their lenders are facing\" section highlights the challenges for office landlords and their lenders, as the General Services Administration (GSA) considers terminating leases on millions of square feet of office space, potentially saving the government $1.87 billion annually by 2028. This move is in response to changing work environments, such as the rise of remote work, and aims to optimize efficiency and cut costs. The impact of these changes is crucial for the commercial real estate sector, which is coping with the effects of extended lease terms and seeking new strategies in a stabilizing post-pandemic market. The government's current leasing portfolio spans large amounts of office space nationwide, with a potential for significant downsizing or reorganization. The overall impact on the commercial real estate market will depend on how the government renegotiates or terminates its leases, influencing real estate markets across sectors and potentially exacerbating financial stress on landlords and lenders. The proposals to sell two-thirds of government-owned office space and terminate three-quarters of leased properties during Trump's term were driven by the underutilization and poor maintenance of many government buildings, particularly in Washington, D.C. This action could lead to depressed prices for older office buildings and a surge in defaults and foreclosures, amid an office mortgage crisis where commercial mortgage-backed securities delinquency rates soared to an unprecedented 11% by the end of 2024. The GSA's large footprint, especially in the Washington DC metro area and other major metros, and their significant lease termination rights add further pressure to an office real estate market already grappling with high vacancy rates and the rise of remote work trends."

        "summary": "The article \"Collapse of the Solar Stocks\" by Wolf Richter from Wolf Street explores the recent downturn in solar stocks, attributing it to broader market phenomena such as fluctuating interest rates and macroeconomic challenges, rather than issues inherent to the solar industry itself. Despite strong industry fundamentals and the promising long-term potential of solar power, stock prices have faltered, demonstrating the speculative nature of the equities market where prices are often dictated by investor sentiment. Highlighted companies within the solar sector, like SunPower, which fell into bankruptcy by 2024 before being acquired by Complete Solaria, saw extreme stock price bubbles driven by speculative mania rather than company performance. Other mentioned companies, including SolarEdge Technologies, Sunrun, Enphase Energy, Shoals Technologies, Sunnova, and Array Technologies, also experienced notable stock price volatility before plummeting due to operational challenges and market shifts. In the section by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street, the article emphasizes that the financial challenges faced by these companies do not reflect the overall viability or growth potential of solar energy, which continues its expansion in the energy market due to improved economics from decreasing photovoltaic panel costs. It differentiates these solar-dedicated firms from larger, diversified energy companies like Tesla. The discussion touches upon the global photovoltaic panel manufacturing dominance of China and the nascent efforts in the US to develop similar capabilities. Ultimately, the article \"This is about stock market craziness, not about solar power,\" concludes that the solar sector's stock price activities are more about stock market volatility than the actual state of solar power itself."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article, authored by Wolf Richter, explores the surge in subprime auto-loan delinquencies while contrasting it with the stable condition of prime auto-loans. In the \"Subprime, Prime, and Overall Auto-Loan Delinquency Rates\" section, it explains that delinquency rates for subprime loans reached a concerning 6.15% in December, setting a record for that month according to Fitch data, whereas prime loan delinquencies remained low at 0.37%. The overall rising delinquency trend is attributed primarily to subprime rates, which suggests this issue is more structural within the subprime segment and not indicative of broader economic distress. The article notes in \"Why this surge in subprime auto-loan delinquencies?\" that the surge is driven by cyclical profit motives and historical securitization practices that originated in the 1990s. While subprime lending remains a small portion of the auto market \u2013 with significant cash transactions in both new and used vehicle purchases \u2013 the appeal of high returns attracts investors and dealers even amid the inherent risks. The article discusses the recurring cycles in the subprime market, which often lead to spikes in delinquency rates and subsequent tightening of credit standards. Despite the challenges and recent financial difficulties and bankruptcies reported in 2023, the subprime auto-loan market's profitability continues to draw interest. This cycle of aggressive lending and delinquency spikes suggests a systemic issue driven by the allure of financial returns, and this pattern is likely to persist."

Various life changes such as job shifts, policy changes regarding remote work, and natural disasters have compelled these homeowners to clear their loans, causing a decline in the share of sub-4% mortgages to 55%, the lowest level since early 2021, as noted in the section \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET.\" The percentage of mortgages with interest rates below 3% has also decreased, now making up 21.3% of all outstanding mortgages as of the third quarter of 2024, down from 24.6% in the first quarter of 2022. Adjustable-rate mortgages have fallen to 2.3% due to rising rates that significantly increase payments for homeowners. Homeowners are generally unwilling to sell due to the \"locked-in effect,\" leading to reduced market activity, and causing existing home sales to reach their lowest volume since 1995, negatively impacting the real estate sector. The \"Meanwhile\" section reveals that mortgages with rates above 6% have doubled to 17.2% of the market by Q3 2024, reflecting higher rates for new purchase and refinance mortgages. While historically low rates below 3% catalyzed a refinance boom between mid-2020 and late 2021, changing circumstances inevitably push even \"locked-in\" homeowners to consider higher-rate mortgages."

Single-family construction starts surged to 1.01 million properties, marking a 6.5% increase and reaching the second-highest level since 2007, which led to an overstock of completed homes as construction outpaced sales. Homebuilders responded by reducing prices and offering incentives to manage this glut. In contrast, multifamily construction starts plummeted by 25% from 2023 and 35% since their peak in 2022, driven by market oversupply, financing challenges, and poor returns due to high-interest rates. Most multifamily projects launched were large-scale, which suffered amid commercial real estate sector difficulties. However, smaller multifamily buildings with 2-4 units increased their starts by 36% in 2024, showing resilience against the commercial real estate downturn. High-end multifamily projects in cities attracted affluent renters, while single-family constructions in suburbs adopted \"build to rent\" models, aiding large landlords in asset management."

CPI Accelerates Further, as Energy & Durable Goods Stopped Plunging,\" discusses the European Central Bank's (ECB) struggle with persistent services inflation within the Euro Area, which has remained at 4.0% for 13 months. The article highlights that this high rate is particularly driven by non-housing related services, as housing service CPI slightly decreased to 3.3%. The ECB is concerned about this due to strong wage pressures and delayed price adjustments from past inflation peaks. Moreover, the Euro Area's Core CPI\u2014excluding food, energy, tobacco, and alcohol\u2014rose by 2.7% in December and has been constant in this range for nine months, driven mostly by services inflation and the stabilization of durable goods prices, which could now push the Core CPI away from the ECB's target if it turns positive. The overall Consumer Price Index (CPI) recorded a rise to 2.4%, continuing its upward trend due to the halt in energy and durable goods deflation and steady food prices. The ECB is now faced with a precarious balancing act as any further cuts in rates may result in the inflation rates surpassing the policy rates, likely worsening the inflation issue instead of mitigating it."

However, \"Amid this strong demand, inflation catches its second wind. The Fed needs to watch out,\" with the CPI increasing by 0.39% in December. Meanwhile, \"But our drunken sailors are not dropping money everywhere equally,\" retail sales focused on nonstore retailers and auto dealers, driven by price changes, while other sectors like gas stations and building materials showed variability, resulting in mixed sales growth. The article notes inflation's resurgence, advising the Fed to monitor for potential economic overheating."

Toronto\u2019s housing market saw a major dip, with single-family home prices falling 19% from their February 2022 peak, and condos hitting a three-year low. Vancouver's real estate market continues its easing trend, with prices falling. Calgary is experiencing a condo market downturn, but other areas like Victoria, Ottawa, and Montreal witnessed mixed results with some price increases year-over-year. In \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET,\" the article notes that nationwide Canadian home prices decreased 0.2% in December month-over-month and year-over-year, marking nine months of continuous declines, with overall home sales falling 5.8% in December, though up 19% compared to the previous year. Despite hopes for relief from mortgage rate cuts by the Bank of Canada, rising rates have affected the market, with a rise in Canadian five-year bond yields. The section \"But every market dances to its own drummer\" details regional variations: Greater Toronto Area saw minor price fluctuations, with Hamilton-Burlington experiencing steep drops, while Greater Vancouver\u2019s and Quebec City Area's prices also declined from their peak. Despite minor changes in Edmonton and Winnipeg, Winnipeg still showed strong year-over-year growth. Each area reflects unique price changes, highlighting the broader complexity of the Canadian housing market during this period."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article, authored by Wolf Richter, provides a detailed examination of inflation as reflected by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). In December, the year-over-year CPI climbed by 2.9%, marking the highest since July, with a monthly surge of 0.39%, translating to a 4.8% annualized rate, the most significant hike since February. Core CPI, excluding food and energy, has remained stable for seven months between 3.1% and 3.3%, indicating persistent underlying inflation pressures. Categories like used and new vehicles, food, and energy, previously contributors to easing CPI, have reversed trends, causing upward pressure. Overall CPI's stabilization is further analyzed under \u201cCore services\u201d CPI, where it experienced a slower annualized growth rate at 3.2% in December, with a six-month core services CPI rising to 4.0% annualized, its peak since August. The housing components of core services section emphasizes how the Owners\u2019 Equivalent of Rent CPI and Rent of Primary Residence CPI, while decelerating year-over-year, remain considerably elevated, reflecting the indirect expenses of homeownership and pre-pandemic normality breaches. In Prices of Goods, used vehicles experienced a 1.2% rise from November, diminishing its year-over-year drop to 3.2%. Meanwhile, new vehicles saw a 0.47% monthly increase, marking solid price levels despite manufacturing surpluses, and underscoring the impact of growing electric vehicle demand. Food inflation shows a notable 3.9% annualized increase for \"Food at home\" items in December, a peak escalation since October 2023, with detailed impacts like a 36.8% rise in egg prices due to avian flu. The apparel and footwear CPI posted a 0.1% monthly rise and a 1.2% year-over-year jump, pointing toward moderate inflation in these nondurable goods. Energy CPI rose by 2.6% from November, reducing its annual decline to 0.5%. Gasoline prices, contributing approximately half of this category, increased by 4.4% month-over-month but still showing a 3.4% year-over-year drop since notable declines starting summer 2022, a key factor in overall CPI slowdown. Hence, the interplay of rising food and energy costs, along with evolving vehicle pricing trends, is significantly impacting the inflation landscape described in the article."

        "summary": "The article \"PPI Inflation Accelerates to +3.3%, Driven by 'Core Services,' +4.0%, both the Worst Readings in Nearly 2 Years\" by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET discusses the recent surge in the Producer Price Index (PPI) inflation, which climbed to 3.3%, marking the highest rate in nearly two years. A key contributor to this increase is the inflation within core services, constituting two-thirds of the PPI, which rose by a substantial 4.0%. This suggests that inflationary pressures in the service sectors are intensifying, playing a significant role in the overall PPI trend and potentially impacting the broader economy in 2024. The December PPI recorded a 3.31% year-over-year increase, the highest since February 2023, with services inflation reaching 4.03%. The PPI's increase reflects an intention by businesses to transfer rising service sector costs to consumers. On a month-over-month basis, the PPI for final demand increased by 0.22%, equivalent to an annualized rate of 2.7%, with energy prices ending their decline to rise by 3.5% in December. While food prices dropped slightly month-to-month, they saw a year-over-year rise of 4.7%. The 'Core' PPI, excluding food and energy, showed a 3.55% year-over-year increase with modest 0.04% monthly growth. The PPI for 'Finished core goods' grew by 2.58% annually, the fastest since December 2023, though the goods sector has lesser inflation concerns. It is the services' costs with an accelerated annual growth of 4.03% and consistent high monthly rises that significantly impact the PPI, highlighting persistent inflation pressures, especially in service industries."

In the \"Some Basics about U.S. Tariffs\" section, it outlines how tariffs boost tax revenues and protect domestic industries, potentially shifting production domestically due to competitive automation costs and sharing the burden of tariffs between importers and manufacturers. In \"What Trump\u2019s Economic Team Said about Tariffs,\" key figures like Stephen Miran, Peter Navarro, Jamieson Greer, Howard Lutnick, Scott Bessent, and Kevin Hassett argue that the U.S. practices one-sided free trade, leaving markets vulnerable. They assert that tariffs can generate revenue, safeguard strategic industries, and serve as negotiation tools without directly causing inflation. Tariffs, according to these appointees, help address the U.S. trade deficit and reduce reliance on foreign production, thus promoting economic stability.

        "summary": "In \"The Most Splendid Housing Bubbles in America, Dec 2024: In 21 of the 33 Metros, Prices Have Now Dropped Below 2022 Peaks\", Wolf Street reports a decline in home prices in many major U.S. cities since their 2022 peaks, indicating a shift in market dynamics. 21 out of 33 metros, including cities like New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Chicago, exhibit this trend. However, cities such as Washington D.C., Miami, Boston, and Atlanta maintain stable prices, reflecting diverse local conditions. This cooling off follows a period of rapid growth driven by economic concerns, interest rate changes, and shifting buyer behavior. The segment \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET\" discusses broader market conditions, noting a reversion to 7% mortgage rates, the lowest existing home demand since 1995, and rising competition from homebuilders. This has led to uneven price movements, with some areas experiencing substantial drops while others remain stable or progressive. According to \"The first 21 metros here are all below their highs in mid-2022, sorted by magnitude of decline\", Austin, San Francisco, Phoenix, San Antonio, and Denver are among metros seeing significant price declines, while Seattle and San Jose report year-over-year increases despite minor drops from 2022 peaks. \"The next 12 markets have set new highs in 2023 or 2024, sorted by year-over-year gain\" highlights metros like Miami, Baltimore, San Diego, and Kansas City achieving new highs recently, with Miami seeing the largest increase since 2000. While these markets exhibit long-term growth since 2000, individual cities within these metros can perform differently, as seen in Washington D.C.'s mixed results between the overall metro and the city. Notably, New York leads Year-over-Year growth with a 6.4% increase. Overall, the article portrays a mixed real estate market showing signs of cooling and stabilization."

        "summary": "In the Wolf Street article, Wolf Richter outlines the recent developments in the Treasury yield curve, highlighting how long-term yields are approaching 5% while short-term yields stay constant, post the Federal Reserve's rate cuts. This trend suggests a steepening of the yield curve since its inversion in 2022, with 2-year and longer-term maturities seeing significant increases after the Fed's 100 basis points rate cut, which stands in contrast to the usual expectations of economic downturns associated with rising longer-term yields. 'The yield curve un-inverted last year and is steepening nicely,' but remains fairly flat with a 37-basis-point spread, as explained in 'The yield curve is still fairly flat and has some ways to go.' The solid labor market, fast economic growth, and re-accelerating inflation have pushed the Fed into a wait-and-see stance. This shift has also impacted mortgage rates, which have surged to 7.24% from historically low levels seen during extensive Federal Reserve interventions post-2009, as discussed in 'Getting used to the old-normal 6% to 8% mortgages?' Consequently, there are now notable increases in yields, with 30-year Treasury bonds being auctioned at their highest yields since 2007, indicating a potential return to pre-2008 mortgage norms. Despite this, markets do not foresee imminent rate cuts, maintaining short-term yield stability."

        "summary": "The article discusses the Federal Reserve's wait-and-see approach amid strong labor market performance and rising inflation. A significant adjustment in employment data is expected in February as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) plans to incorporate contributions from recent immigrants, potentially reshaping perceptions of the labor market's strength. The current economic activities, coupled with accelerating inflation, suggest the Fed may hold off on major policy changes until the new data is analyzed. According to Wolf Richter, in December, nonfarm payrolls increased by 256,000, resulting in a total of 159.5 million jobs, with a three-month average increase aligning with previous months and marking the largest rise since May. Over the past year, employers added 2.23 million jobs, exceeding the pre-pandemic average by 5%, indicating robust job growth despite higher interest rates. The labor market's strength and economic growth have led to speculation that the Fed's policy rates may be nearing neutrality, reducing the need for further cuts. Inflation risks have also minimized the chances of rate cuts, in line with a 3.4% annualized rise in average hourly earnings in December, with a year-over-year increase of 3.9%. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1% in December, the lowest unrounded rate since June, and maintained this average over seven months, showcasing stabilization at healthy levels. In the section titled \"Employment to be adjusted in February for 8 million new legal and illegal migrants,\" the Census Bureau's updated population data indicates an increase of 8.01 million people, mainly due to immigration, which hasn't been included in current employment statistics but will be in February's report. This represents the largest U.S. population jump in 23 years, expected to lead to significant employment metric adjustments. Adjustments aim to restore the historical relationship between household survey and nonfarm payroll figures, with the household survey traditionally reporting higher employment numbers. This gap has narrowed but is set to widen again with February's adjustments, changing the household employment margin over nonfarm payroll numbers."

        "summary": "The article \"Bond Market Rout\" in the UK, highlighted on Wolf Street and authored by Wolf Richter, examines the significant rise in UK government bond yields, drawing parallels with the US bond market. The 10-year yield in the UK has surged to 4.82%, marking its highest level since 2008, while the 30-year yield reached 5.47%, the highest since 1998, surpassing US Treasury yields. This uptick has sparked notable discussions in financial media, with phrases like \"gilt market rout\" and \"return of the bond vigilantes\" gaining popularity. This shift in yields occurs after years of extremely low interest rates driven by global interest rate suppression, largely due to actions like the Bank of England's quantitative easing (QE) and maintenance of minimal rates. Back in July 2020, the 10-year gilt yield fell to a historic low of 0.09%, with expectations of potentially turning negative, perpetuating a 40-year bond bull market. The resurgence of inflation, however, prompted interest rate hikes by the Bank of England, bringing the 10-year yield back to pre-ZIRP normalcy. The article suggests that this return to more typical yield levels is crucial, fostering necessary fiscal discipline among governments and investors, and correcting the imbalances fostered during the era of cheap borrowing costs. This transition, though challenging, is ultimately beneficial, as a normal cost of capital is essential for reestablishing a sustainable and disciplined fiscal environment."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article titled \"Why Used-Vehicle Prices May Put Upward Pressure on CPI, after Having Been a Powerful Contributor to Cooling Inflation\" by Wolf Richter explores the factors influencing used vehicle prices and their impact on the consumer price index (CPI). The piece discusses how new-vehicle shortages from 2021 and 2022 have curtailed the supply of used cars, though demand remains strong, leading to potential upward pressure on prices and, consequently, the CPI. In the section \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET,\" it is noted that after contributing to inflation between 2020-2021, used-vehicle prices declined in 2022-2023, which helped lower overall inflation rates. However, this downward trend leveled off by 2024 due to tight inventory and sustained demand, particularly from rental fleets and lease terminations, reversing the year-over-year decline that began in August 2022. The section \"Prices are still too high, by powertrain: ICE and EV\" highlights the severe price increases for both internal combustion engine (ICE) and electric vehicles (EV), spurred by factors like access to \"free money\" during 2020-2021. Despite some deflation, ICE and EV prices remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. A constrained supply of new vehicles, largely due to semiconductor shortages impacting global production in 2021 and 2022, has greatly reduced the supply of used vehicles, exacerbated by shortages in rental fleets and lease terminations, with this tightness forecasted to persist until 2026, as detailed in the section \"Pushing up into inflation figures.\" This supply crunch contrasts with solid demand, reflected in a 13% year-over-year increase in used vehicle retail sales in December. The section also notes that the significant 28% drop in the CPI for used vehicles from early 2022 to mid-2024, which helped calm core inflation, stalled at mid-2024 with prices increasing 5.1% between September and November. Despite a 3.4% yearly decrease in November, it's expected that the year-over-year figures will soon turn positive, driven by last year's low numbers, with December CPI data anticipated to further illuminate this trend."

Fed Faces Scenario of Solid Job Market, Re-accelerating Inflation | Wolf Street\" by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET, discusses the recent developments in the US labor market, where job openings in November increased to 8.10 million, the highest since May. This indicates a strong demand for labor, despite a decrease in voluntary quits to 3.06 million. Notably, sectors like professional and business services, as well as finance, have seen substantial increases in job openings, pointing to the creation of new positions rather than filling existing ones. The article highlights the challenge this robust job market poses for the Federal Reserve, which is now more cautious about potential interest rate cuts due to the risk of re-accelerating inflation. Consequently, the Fed has altered its expectations, now projecting only two 25-basis-point cuts and raising its inflation and federal funds rate projections. The number of job openings per unemployed person has risen to 1.13, reflecting labor-market tightness. Even though layoffs and discharges have slightly increased to 1.76 million, the layoff rate remains historically low at 1.11%, suggesting that employers are retaining workers. However, hiring has declined by 125,000 to a total of 5.27 million, marking a second consecutive month of decreases, indicating that employers are holding onto their workforce while creating new job opportunities, contrary to the reduced need for replacements due to fewer layoffs and voluntary quits. This situation underscores the complexity the Fed faces in balancing economic growth and inflation control, as it carefully monitors these economic indicators to guide future monetary policy decisions."

The section \"Bank of Japan Balance Sheet: QT Takes Off, Assets Drop to Lowest in 15 Months\" details how the BOJ is systematically reducing its balance sheet since mid-2022, particularly in government securities and loans, reflecting a strategic shift from QE strategies towards a restrictive monetary policy approach. The \"The yen paid the price for QE in 2012-2022\" section highlights the devaluation of the yen by 46% against the US dollar due to QE and its impact on inflation, which reached 2.9% in November 2024.

Lastly, \"The other diversification: gold\" section describes central banks' increased gold holdings over the past decade, with total reserves reaching 1.16 billion troy ounces valued at $3.08 trillion in contrast to foreign exchange reserves at $12.3 trillion.

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter provides an update on the Federal Reserve's balance sheet and its quantitative tightening strategy as of December. According to the \"Fed Balance Sheet QT\" section, the Fed reduced its balance sheet by $43 billion in December, bringing the total to $6.85 trillion, which marks a $2.11 trillion decline from its peak and amounts to a 23.6% decrease. This reduction highlights the Fed's post-pandemic reversal, where it has already trimmed 44% of the $4.81 trillion balance sheet increase from the pandemic era. The \"QT assets by category\" section explains that the Fed reduced its Treasury securities by $24.5 billion in December, marking a 26% decline since June 2022. This aligns with the broader plan to unwind $3.27 trillion in pandemic-acquired Treasuries, with 45% already offloaded. The article notes a shift as global investors take up more U.S. national debt, which now stands at $36.1 trillion in total, with $28.87 trillion held publicly. The \"Bank liquidity facilities\" section highlights the status of the Fed's bank liquidity measures, newly focused on the Discount Window and Bank Term Funding Program as other facilities have minimal balances. The balance of the BTFP dropped sharply after a market-rate flaw was exploited, leading to a temporary spike before correction, and no new loans have been issued since, with the program set to end in March 2024. The Discount Window has slightly increased to $3.2 billion in December, far beneath the $153 billion peak during the March 2023 bank panic. With the Fed charging 4.50% interest and requiring collateral, Chair Jerome Powell has pushed for banks to use the Discount Window more regularly and to prepare for transitional transactions to ensure readiness for future requirements."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article \"What Should Tesla\u2019s Stock Be Worth? Automaker, Stagnating Vehicle Sales like General Motors & Ford, Getting Overtaken by Competitors, Losing Share in the Booming EV Market?\" by Wolf Richter examines Tesla\u2019s declining position in the electric vehicle market. Tesla, previously a leader in the EV space, is now encountering intensified competition from established automakers and newcomers. Its vehicle sales growth has stalled, paralleling trends seen in traditional automakers like General Motors and Ford. In 2024, Tesla's global deliveries declined by 1.1% to 1.789 million vehicles, with a modest Q4 growth of 2.3%. In contrast, competitors like China's BYD saw a 12% increase in EV deliveries, overtaking Tesla in Q4. Other Chinese manufacturers, such as Li Auto, Nio, and Xpeng, also reported significant sales growth. In the U.S., companies like General Motors and Ford recorded substantial increases in EV sales, with Ford rising 45% and General Motors 24%, even after discontinuing the Bolt series. The auto industry, challenged by slow internal combustion engine sales, witnessed rising EV demand, though Tesla\u2019s performance was underwhelming, contributing only a 10% increase in U.S. EV sales in 2024. As the dominance of Tesla wanes amidst a growing EV landscape, \"So how much should Tesla be worth?\" questions Tesla's stock valuation amidst stagnating sales and robust competition. Tesla's P/E ratio of 103.2 starkly contrasts with Ford's and General Motors', suggesting it should realign closer to industry norms, perhaps around a P/E ratio of 15. Despite successfully becoming a profitable global automaker with $33 billion in cash, Tesla faces challenges as a mid-sized player in a competitive market. Its significant influence in encouraging traditional automakers to invest in EVs is acknowledged, yet the article suggests that Tesla's stock should now reflect its evolved market role and trade similarly to its automotive peers in General Motors and Ford, despite ongoing Wall Street hype."

        "summary": "Wolf Street by Wolf Richter discusses the long-term performance of global stock markets, focusing on the S&P 500's exceptional gains compared to major global markets in Japan, China, Hong Kong, India, the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Canada. The S&P 500's outperformance is partly due to currency fluctuations, with the depreciation of the Japanese yen and Indian rupee decreasing returns for USD investors in those stocks. It underscores the importance of considering currency risks in international investing. In the Global Stocks over the Long Term section, it attributes the S&P 500's dramatic 253% increase since May 2013 largely to aggressive monetary policies like the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing. However, the shift to quantitative tightening by the Federal Reserve and actions by other central banks like the European Central Bank may reverse the liquidity-driven growth that benefited the S&P 500. In the Foreign Stock Markets section, the article notes the substantial local currency gains of Japanese and Indian markets since 2010, which were eroded for US investors due to currency depreciation. It also reviews other key indices like China's SSE and Hong Kong's HSI, detailing their performance metrics and long-term trends."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter titled \"Office CMBS Delinquency Rate Spikes to a Record 11%, Blowing by the Financial Crisis Peak,\" discusses the severe challenges faced by the office real estate market, highlighted by the office Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (CMBS) delinquency rate hitting a record 11% in December. This rate surpasses the previous peak during the financial crisis, following a 9.4 percentage point increase over the past two years, indicating significant deterioration in the office sector compared to other commercial real estate sectors like lodging and retail. The article attributes this financial distress to remote work trends, oversupply of office space, and rising interest rates. The \"extend and pretend\" strategy, mainly involving temporary debt deferral, is proving unsustainable as it fails to address the core issue of excess office space worsened by pandemic-driven changes and increased vacancies. While there are rumors of potential debt renegotiations and write-offs, converting office spaces to residential use remains viable only for select buildings. Despite US banks holding substantial office loans and initiating some write-downs, the distribution of office mortgage debt globally reduces the potential risk impact on the US banking system. The overall office debt, less than $1 trillion, does not pose a critical threat to the broader banking infrastructure. With defaults rising, the outlook for office space-related investments remains uncertain, making the situation urgent for finding viable solutions amid the ongoing office debt meltdown."

        "summary": "The article titled \"Buyers\u2019 Strike Continues: Pending Home Sales Remain Deep in the Frozen Zone though up a Tad from Rock Bottom\" from Wolf Street highlights the significant downturn in the US housing market, characterized by a persistent reluctance from buyers amid high home prices. According to Wolf Richter, despite a slight rise in pending home sales from historic lows, the current levels remain weak due to ongoing high costs, leading to a buyers' strike where potential purchasers leverage improved negotiating power. The National Association of Realtors (NAR) reports that November saw a 20.1% drop in sales, influenced by Thanksgiving, but seasonal adjustments indicated a minor increase. Historical analysis reveals fluctuating November trends over recent years, while pending sales by region showed that although the South saw a notable increase in seasonally adjusted figures, all regions experienced significant declines without adjustments. NAR also notes that buyers are acclimating to stable, higher mortgage rates above 6%, adjusting market dynamics in favor of buyers and away from the previous seller-dominated market. With mortgage rates back in the old-normal range, the article notes their increase to 6.85% in late December, reflecting a return to pre-quantitative easing era levels, with analysts predicting ultra-low rates are unlikely to return. Supply is piling up as new home inventory increases, with homebuilders offering incentives like mortgage-rate buydowns, bolstering new home sales despite a decline in existing home sales. Inventory has grown by 8.1% on a year-over-year basis, signaling a significant rise in housing stock. However, the buyers\u2019 strike continued into December, with mortgage applications showing only a slight improvement from last year's extreme lows but still markedly below levels seen in 2019, 2021, and last year, indicating an ongoing stagnation in home buying activity despite minor gains."

The section \"The yield curve steepened nicely after un-inverting entirely.\" explains that longer-term Treasury yields have risen, prompting a steepening of the yield curve after it fully un-inverted, with short-term yields stable. The divergence, as explored in \"Why the divergence of the 10-year yield from the EFFR?\" arises from robust economic growth and a strong labor market, conditions typically correlating with higher yields, even as the Fed reduced rates due to easing inflation. \"The bond market is getting a wee bit nervous.\" highlights market anxieties over inflation reemergence, driven by US fiscal policies and deficits, alongside the Fed's shift in cut projections, necessitating higher yields to attract buyers amidst Quantitative Tightening. Further, \"Mortgage rates back around 7%.\" discusses the rise in mortgage rates post-September cut, returning to historically normal levels, causing frustration in real estate but indicating a return to pre-2008 crisis norms. This complex landscape suggests market forces responding to broader economic signals beyond Fed actions."

This downturn is linked to significant job losses in the tech sector of Silicon Valley and San Francisco, following a period of excessive hiring described as a \"drunken hiring binge.\" The section titled \"Unsustainable home-price spikes are, well, unsustainable\" highlights that single-family home prices have dropped by 15.4% from their peak in May 2022, after previously experiencing a 160% surge over a decade that led to a severe \"Housing Crisis.\" Condo prices have similarly decreased by 14.7% from their peak, driven by a combination of new developments and an economic push to balance affordability. The \"Jobs in San Francisco & Northern Part of Silicon Valley\" section details the elimination of over 42,000 positions in key tech industries since their peak in August 2022. While AI dynamics continue to influence employment, the recent tech job market has stabilized but not to the severe extent seen during the Dotcom Bust. Overall, private sector employment in the San Francisco-Silicon Valley area has fallen by about 3.5% since mid-2022, with the most substantial losses previously occurring in sectors like Leisure, Hospitality, and Retail during the pandemic.

The Federal Reserve, despite reducing its holdings through its Quantitative Tightening program, still retains 15.4% of the debt. The article delineates in \"Who held this $35.46 trillion in Treasury securities at the end of Q3?\" that US government entities held $7.16 trillion internally through mechanisms like federal civilian and military pension funds and other trust funds, while $28.31 trillion is controlled by the \"public.\" In \"Who is this \u2018public\u2019?\" it is revealed that foreign investors hold $8.67 trillion or 30.6%, with major players like financial centers and countries such as the Euro Area, Japan, and China-Hong Kong, although China's investments have declined while the Euro Area has supplemented this gap. US mutual funds represent 17.6% of the public debt, US individuals hold 10.3%, state and local governments, including pension funds, account for 6.4%, and commercial banks hold 6.1%. The article ends by addressing concerns in the section \"An analysis of the US national debt highlights a troubling trend,\" highlighting the worsening fiscal health due to an unprecedented spike in the Interest-Payments-to-Tax-Receipts ratio and growing debt-to-GDP ratio, urging the need for strategies to manage the high-interest payments for fiscal sustainability."

As a result, home prices have decreased to the lowest since 2021, yet they remain elevated. Homebuilder Lennar plans to cut prices by 16% from the 2022 peak to manage oversupply and boost demand. In November, unsold new houses soared by 57% year-over-year to 124,000, the highest since June 2009 during the Housing Bust, based on Census Bureau data. Homebuilders are employing strategies such as lowering prices and enhancing incentives to attract buyers, yet unsold inventories across all construction stages still increased by 8.1% year-over-year to 493,000 houses, the highest since December 2007, causing pressure on prices and challenges for homebuilders. In the \"Prices Drop, Incentives Surge\" section, it is emphasized that big homebuilders like Lennar are aggressively lowering prices and offering incentives to maintain sales, leading to squeezed profit margins. The median contract price for new homes dropped significantly, reaching $402,600, and Lennar reported a decline in sales revenue and lower average sales prices, projecting further declines and refraining from full-year guidance due to uncertain market conditions. The \"Sales are Decent, Thanks to Price Cuts and Incentives\" section highlights sales increases driven by price reductions and incentives, with a 14% rise from last year and a 33% increase over two years, projecting 681,000 annual sales for new houses, surpassing any year in the previous 11-year period. However, sales of existing single-family houses have sharply declined to their lowest since 1995 due to sellers maintaining high prices, which reduces demand. Lastly, the \"Prices of New Houses versus Existing Houses\" section notes that while new houses have historically been priced higher than existing ones, this trend is shifting as incentives make monthly payments for new homes more competitive, sustaining homebuilders' sales and causing a decrease in existing home sales."

        "summary": "The article \"Treasury Yield Curve Un-Inverts Entirely, as Long-Term Yields Rise while Short-Term Yields Stay Put, No Longer Pricing in Rate Cuts. Mortgage Rates back Above 7% | Wolf Street\" by Wolf Richter discusses significant developments in the Treasury yield curve, which has fully \"un-inverted\" due to rising long-term yields while short-term yields stabilize, indicating markets are not anticipating further rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Despite a 100 basis point cut since September, the 10-year Treasury yield has surged by 87 basis points, raising questions about future rate reductions, consequently pushing mortgage rates above 7% and tightening financing conditions for homeowners. The section authored by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street outlines the Federal Reserve's recent 25 basis point rate cut projecting higher inflation and fewer rate cuts by 2025, which, paired with Jerome Powell's comments about a recalibration phase possibly ending, impacted market sentiment and resulted in a 3% drop in the S&P 500. This announcement led to unchanged short-term yields and diminished expectations for short-term rate cuts. In the section \"The entire yield curve un-inverted entirely,\" we learn that both 10-year and 30-year yields have risen, following an inversion that started in July 2022. Although the yield curve remains flat, there is a slight 22-basis point difference between the 2-year and 10-year yields, with a potential future steepening to normalize. In \"Yields v. the Effective Federal Funds Rate,\" after the Federal Reserve adjusted the target for the Effective Federal Funds Rate (EFFR), resulting in lower rates, varied Treasury yield movements were noted, with longer-term yields displaying a steepened curve surpassing the EFFR. As noted in \"Mortgage rates back above 7%,\" the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has exceeded 7%, up from 6.11%, paralleling the 10-year Treasury yield rise and maintaining a wide spread reminiscent of levels seen before the 2008 financial crisis."

This decrease resulted from the Fed's decision to cut the ON RRP rate by five basis points, complementing an overall 25-basis-point policy rate cut. The goal is to push money market funds toward higher-yielding alternatives like Treasury bills, redistributing excess liquidity that the Fed accumulated during quantitative easing (QE). These funds are the primary users of ON RRP, which currently contains surplus liquidity. As part of its quantitative tightening (QT) initiative, the Fed has withdrawn $2.1 trillion, mainly from ON RRP balances, and seeks to reduce reserves from \"abundant\" to \"ample.\" However, reserves have remained unchanged since QT began. The article highlights that the ON RRP rate is linked to the lower bound of the federal funds rate range, initially increased by the Fed in June 2021 due to market conditions. The recent trimming of the ON RRP rate aligns it once again with the lower boundary of the target range, aiming for low or negligible ON RRP balances as QT progresses."

He emphasizes that while there has been some relief in inflation due to deflation in durable goods, this trend shows signs of ending, necessitating the continuation of restrictive monetary policies to address persistent inflationary pressures. Powell underscores the caution needed in interpreting inflation data, emphasizing the importance of long-term trends over short-term fluctuations, as demonstrated by the deceleration of the PCE price index in November. Despite a consistent downward trend in inflation, restrictive policies remain essential. The section \"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell noted the persistence of inflation in the services sector\" highlights the stabilization of durable goods prices, which decelerated past inflation but now contribute to the acceleration of core and overall PCE price indexes. The section \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET: \" shows durable goods inflation hovering at -0.4%, while core services inflation remains elevated with no substantial moderation. Regarding food and energy prices, food inflation sees a moderate acceleration resulting in the highest year-over-year increase since March, impacting the overall PCE. Meanwhile, energy prices, previously a factor in reducing inflation, show volatility and a potential end to their deceleration contributions. Overall, the Federal Reserve's cautious, long-term-focused approach aims for sustained reduction in inflationary pressures."

This revision will impact economic metrics, particularly employment numbers, as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) plans to adjust its total employment figures upwards by early 2025 to align with the revised estimates. The section \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET\" elaborates that the updated figures stem from a more accurate measurement of immigration from 2021 to 2024, addressing previously underestimated immigrant numbers that clouded policymakers' understanding of labor supply and employment. The dramatic rise in immigration, marked as the largest population increase in decades, particularly in 2024, is due to improved methodology in capturing international migration data. The section titled \"Coming Up-Revisions of Total Employment & Labor Force\" explains that the BLS is set to incorporate these updated population data into employment figures, resulting in substantial revisions in labor force, total employment, and unemployment metrics. These will account for the new immigrant workers seeking jobs, irrespective of their legal status, while re-aligning household survey-based employment figures with those from nonfarm payrolls to correct discrepancies caused by the exclusion of self-employed and farm workers in the latter."

The \"Buyers\u2019 strike leads to lowest annual sales since 1995\" section describes how annual sales in 2024 are projected at only 4.04 million, the lowest since 1995, due to high home prices and mortgage rates returning to traditional levels of 6-7%.

        "summary": "In the article \"Fed Cuts by 25 Basis Points, to 4.25%-4.50%, Sees Only 2 Cuts in 2025, Sees Higher Inflation, Higher \u201cLonger-Run\u201d Rates. QT Continues\" by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street, the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates by 25 basis points to a target range of 4.25%-4.50% signals a shift from earlier expectations of aggressive rate cuts. The Fed now projects only two cuts in 2025 as it anticipates increased inflation and higher long-term rates. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) implemented this policy move, noting only one dissenting voice from Beth M. Hammack. They also lowered the Overnight Reverse Repos offering rate, pushing money market funds towards other placements and extending the Fed's Quantitative Tightening (QT) process. The FOMC summarized revised economic projections, setting the target for the federal funds rate at 3.875% by the end of 2025. Diverse views among FOMC members forecast between no cuts to five potential cuts, reflecting a range of economic outlooks. The committee emphasized ongoing economic expansion, modest inflation progress, and its commitment to employment and inflation goals. With economic risks viewed as balanced, the Fed plans to adjust its monetary policy based on incoming data, remaining cautious of any threats to its dual objectives."

        "summary": "In the second half of the year, US retail sales experienced a sharp acceleration, highlighting robust consumer demand, which could potentially challenge the Federal Reserve's efforts to control inflation. Retail sales in November increased by 0.7% from October, reaching $720 billion, with a three-month average growth rate of 0.7%, resulting in an annualized growth rate of 8.6%. Several factors underpin this surge, including wage increases surpassing inflation, strong financial conditions like low debt burdens and substantial cash reserves, and a growing population due to immigration. The category breakdown reveals that vehicle sales and ecommerce drive much of this growth, contributing to 36% of total sales, with year-over-year increases of 6.5% for vehicle sales and 9.8% for ecommerce. However, food services, drinking places, and food and beverage stores observed modest yearly growth of 1.9% and 1.8%, respectively. General merchandise stores like Walmart showed a steady 3.4% year-over-year increase, whereas gas station sales declined by 3.9% due to falling gasoline prices. After a post-pandemic decline, sectors like building materials and garden supply saw a recovery with a 5.8% increase, while health and personal care stores and clothing and accessory stores recorded 2.2% growth. This dynamic retail landscape highlights the importance of careful monitoring by the Federal Reserve to manage demand without worsening inflation."

        "summary": "The article \"Housing Bubble & Bust #1 and #2 as Seen through Employment in Mortgage Lending\" by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street delves into the significant contraction in employment within the nonbank mortgage lending sector, highlighting a 37% reduction in employment, which marks the lowest rates since 1997. This downtrend is indicative of broader economic challenges and the cyclical nature of employment in this sector, heavily influenced by fluctuations in the housing market and lending practices. Between June 2021 and June 2024, nonbank mortgage lenders faced decreased mortgage originations, driven in part by automation, which reduced the need for human labor. Nonbank lenders like Rocket Mortgage and United Wholesale Mortgage now lead the market over traditional banks and credit unions. Employment in mortgage brokering also experienced a steep decline, with a 32% reduction by October 2024, mirroring the first housing bust. Despite these job losses, the overall impact on the US labor market remains minimal. The article also mentions a drastic drop in mortgage application activity, with refinance applications down by 70% from 2019 and 81% from 2022, alongside a 40% decline in home purchase applications from 2019 and a 48% drop from 2021. These trends underscore the volatility in the market following post-bubble corrections, as mortgage rates and the broader macroeconomic environment significantly influence the housing market's dynamics."

It notes increased home sales for the fourth consecutive month, with a 2.8% rise from October to November and a 26% rise compared to last year, though sales volumes are still down over 20% from levels seen in 2020 and 2021. The article's section \"Home prices by metro in Canada\" details the varied housing trends across metro areas: Greater Toronto Area sees a slight rise in single-family home prices but a drop in condos, mirroring similar trends in Hamilton-Burlington; Greater Vancouver experiences monthly drops in both housing types but a slight annual rise in single-family home prices; Ottawa and Victoria show mixed results; Calgary sees a decline in condo prices despite yearly gains; Quebec City shows significant growth in single-family homes; Edmonton reveals dramatic long-term value changes since 2007; Halifax-Dartmouth faces a steep decline in condo prices, contrasting with the steady growth in single-family homes. Overall, the decline in condo prices suggests a shift in real estate preferences or economic conditions affecting affordability and demand, while single-family home prices indicate a stabilization at post-peak levels."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article \"Treasury Yield Curve Un-Inverts Further on Surging Longer-Term Yields: 10-Year Yield Now Higher than All Shorter Yields. Mortgage Rates Resurge\" by Wolf Richter discusses recent developments in the bond market and their implications. Since last September, despite the Federal Reserve's 75-basis-point rate cut, the 10-year Treasury yield has risen by the same amount to 4.40%, driven by concerns over inflationary pressures and an increase in government bond supply. This has led to an \"un-inversion\" of the yield curve, with 10-year yields now surpassing shorter-term yields, although full normalization is yet to occur. The 30-year Treasury yield also surged to 4.61%, influenced by similar factors, including anticipated new debt issuance to cover deficits, even as the Fed tightens the economic flow. Additionally, the 2-year Treasury yield increased by 66 basis points to 4.25% since September due to market adjustments to inflation expectations and fiscal policy changes. In the \"The 'yield curve' in the process of un-inverting\" section, the author explains that while the yield curve, inverted since July 2022 due to higher policy rates, shows signs of returning to a more typical relationship, it remains slightly above normalization. Mortgage rates have re-risen as well, detailed in the \"Mortgage rates have re-risen\" section, with the average 30-year fixed rate reaching 6.95%, a consequence of the increased spread as the 10-year Treasury yield rises. This unexpected rise in mortgage rates has surprised the housing industry, which, already challenged by high pandemic-era home prices, faces the lowest demand for existing homes since 1995. Developers are now working to sell an inventory of unsold homes that is the largest since 2009, indicating that rate cuts have yet to effectively stimulate the housing market."

        "summary": "In a recent Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter, it was observed that the management of Americans' cash has significantly shifted in response to fluctuating interest rates and economic conditions. In the Money Market Funds section, it was highlighted that households have increasingly turned towards money market funds, with an increase of $167 billion in the third quarter, raising total holdings to $4.11 trillion even as yields fell due to Federal Reserve rate cuts. Total money market fund balances, including institutional holdings, saw a substantial increase of $291 billion to $6.84 trillion. Meanwhile, the Large Certificates of Deposit section described that large time deposits (CDs of $100,000 or more) maintained their high levels after a 67% surge since March 2022, although their growth has since plateaued. In the Small Certificates of Deposit section, small time deposits (CDs below $100,000) experienced a noticeable decline in response to the rate cuts, reflecting their sensitivity to interest rate changes. Finally, the Total Deposits section reported an increase in total deposits at commercial banks to $17.9 trillion by November, recovering a significant amount of the $1 trillion decrease that occurred between March 2022 and May 2023 due to the collapse or shutdown of several banks, including Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic. As banks strive to compete with rising money market fund yields, they have resorted to offering higher interest rates on CDs and savings accounts to retain and attract deposits, a measure that has proven costly for banks. These dynamics underscore how Americans are adapting their savings strategies in a volatile economic environment."

        "summary": "The article \"The ECB Steps Away from Bond Market Entirely, Speeds Up Bond QT even as it Cut Rates\" by Wolf Richter on Wolf Street discusses the European Central Bank's (ECB) significant reduction of its balance sheet by \u20ac2.48 trillion as part of its quantitative tightening (QT) efforts. The ECB is stepping away from bond market interventions and has decided to accelerate its bond QT program by allowing bonds to mature without replacement, starting after December 17. This move marks a shift from the ECB\u2019s previous quantitative easing programs, the \"Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme\" (PEPP) and the \"Asset Purchase Programme\" (APP), which focused on government securities. The ECB\u2019s strategy contrasts with the U.S. Federal Reserve's approach, which maintains caps to slow its QT process. The ECB started its QT in late 2022 by changing loan terms, leading banks to repay nearly all \u20ac2.22 trillion in loans. As bond QT progresses, the ECB's balance sheet has diminished, and its total assets have shrunk significantly, reflecting a broader trend among major central banks towards pre-pandemic monetary policies. Simultaneously, the ECB continues to cut interest rates amid slower economic growth, indicating a shift in focus to monitoring financial stability and inflation dynamics."

The article also reflects on how these economic and policy changes are affecting real estate trends across U.S. metropolitan statistical areas, with Austin experiencing the most significant drop from its peak by 22%, while emphasizing the need to reassess market conditions as housing dynamics evolve. Noteworthy is the long-term growth since 2000 in areas like San Jose and Miami, which have seen home price increases of over 300%."

In the Core Services PPI section, it is noted that this has led to visible adjustments in monthly and yearly data throughout 2024. Meanwhile, the Core Goods PPI section reveals that the PPI for \"finished core goods,\" which excludes food and energy, saw minor revisions, with a 2.5% year-over-year rise in November. Though initially stable, the deceleration in core goods inflation has ceased, contributing to an overall inflationary environment, challenging previous assessments and potentially affecting economic policy, business, and consumer decisions."

The \"Apparel and footwear\" section reported a modest month-to-month and year-over-year increase by 1.1%. Finally, in the \"Energy\" section, the CPI showed a minor monthly rise but an annual decline, notably with gasoline 8.1% lower year-over-year and 32% since the summer of 2021 peak, contributing to the overall inflationary trends despite a recent uptick."

Initially met with enthusiasm by Wall Street, GM's ambition faced substantial setbacks, leading to $10 billion in losses. Technological and regulatory challenges prompted GM to shut down the venture, marking a setback in its autonomous driving goals. Richter explains that GM's restructuring aims to incorporate Cruise's technical team into personal vehicle autonomous and assisted driving projects, hoping to cut spending by over $1 billion annually. Following this decision, GM's shares initially rose but later declined in after-hours trading. The venture faced severe setbacks this year, notably a pedestrian accident caused by a human driver and a Cruise vehicle, which led to regulatory issues, vehicle recalls, layoffs, and a leadership overhaul. Cruise admitted to concealing the incident, resulting in criminal charges and a DOJ settlement. Despite the industry's potential, minor accidents attract significant scrutiny, as seen with Waymo's continued success contrasted by Cruise's decline. GM CEO Mary Barra highlighted the complexities of the robotaxi business, emphasizing challenges beyond deploying technology."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter, titled \"Credit-Market Mania Crushed 'Yield Spreads' & Risk Premiums, but Corporate & CRE Borrowing Costs Are Still Much Higher,\" explores the dynamics of the current financial environment in the credit markets. Despite the perception of eased financial conditions since 2023, reminiscent of 2021's loose policies with near-zero Federal Reserve rates and aggressive quantitative easing, corporate and commercial real estate borrowing costs remain elevated. This paradox is driven by narrow yield spreads as observed in indices like the Chicago Fed\u2019s National Financial Conditions Index and the St. Louis Fed Financial Stress Index, which do not translate to reduced borrowing costs. In the corporate credit space, the article highlights the scene of junk-rated securities, notably leveraged loans and junk bonds. Leveraged loans, now based mostly on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) that replaced LIBOR, have total rates of about 8.35%, a sharp rise from 2021, yet see strong investor demand for the higher risk and limited yield. Junk bonds, typically fixed-rate, have also seen renewed issuance due to investor interest, with BB-rated corporate bonds yielding 5.71%, indicating doubled rates from 2021 lows, though down from their peak last October. The yield spread with Treasury equivalents has narrowed, spurring a surge in issuance alongside leveraged loans. This narrowing, coupled with high issuance, signals a euphoric credit market atmosphere despite prevailing higher rates, underscoring the complexities and challenges in today's borrowing landscape where risk premiums may have been reduced but actual borrowing costs remain significant."

Auction prices increased by 1.3% in November from October according to the Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index, marking the first year-over-year price rise since August 2022 and impacting inflation by adding new pressure as previously falling prices had eased core inflation. Discussed in the section \"The Used-Vehicle Pipeline is Messed Up, and Will Be for Years,\" the market faces ongoing disruptions, including reduced lease maturities impacting the availability of two to three-year-old vehicles, and a semiconductor shortage that resulted in 10 million fewer new vehicle sales from 2021 to 2023, constraining future used vehicle supply. Despite a 15% year-over-year increase in sales in November, retail inventories remain tight. In \"Powerful Inflation Tailwind Turned into Headwind,\" the article notes a previous 28% drop in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for used vehicles from 2022 to mid-2024, previously helping to cool core CPI. However, with a recent 2.7% CPI rise in October reducing the year-over-year decline to 3.4%, rising used vehicle prices are now exerting inflationary pressure, contributing to an acceleration in metrics like the core CPI and core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index."

The unemployment rate increased slightly to 4.2% in November, despite Fed forecasts for a higher rate by end of 2024. In \"The wave of migrants and the coming revision of the Household Survey data,\" the challenges of accurately tracking employment data due to the migrant influx are noted, leading to a planned BLS revision in January to address discrepancies between household and nonfarm payroll data. The influx of immigrants has increased the unemployment rate due to a larger labor supply. Finally, \"Careful with those rate cuts!\" discusses the Fed's cautious strategy toward rate cuts due to uncertainties around the neutral rate, suggesting a wait-and-see approach to avoid overreaction and possible abrupt rate hikes if inflation re-escalates. The article emphasizes flexibility in policy as the Fed considers the strong economic indicators of GDP growth and labor market strength."

Market-based borrowing rate discrepancies initially fueled BTFP usage, but the Fed's rate revisions and closure plans aim to phase it out by 2025. The Discount Window, favored by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, faces interest costs but aims to eliminate usage stigma. Finally, What else caused total assets on the balance sheet to drop? notes reductions in Treasury securities, MBS, BTFP borrowings, and the narrowing of \"Other assets\" and \"Unamortized premiums,\" contributing to the balance sheet's $98 billion shrinkage in November, with ongoing adjustments reflecting interest accruals and bond premium depreciation."

        "summary": "In the Wolf Street article \"Everybody Should Get Used to these Mortgage Rates, Says Fannie Mae CEO: Mortgage Rates, 10-Year Treasury Yields, QT, and Spreads\" by Wolf Richter, Priscilla Almodovar, CEO of Fannie Mae, highlights that the current mortgage rates echo historical averages from decades past, and the public should adapt to these levels. This normalization follows the pandemic era of astoundingly low rates, which were a result of specific monetary policies and economic circumstances. Fannie Mae's projections for 2025 suggest that rates will likely stabilize around these historical norms, implying future fluctuations will remain within this range. Additionally, mortgage rates are intricately linked to the yields on 10-year Treasury notes, which have been rising due to Federal Reserve measures such as Quantitative Tightening (QT) and interest rate hikes aimed at controlling inflation. The widening spread between mortgage rates and Treasury yields represents the economic environment and financial market expectations adjusting to a typical rate landscape. As the mortgage market realigns, borrowers should expect higher rates compared to the recent past, yet these align with traditional levels seen historically. It's crucial for individuals and institutions to factor these normalizing conditions into their planning and adjust financial strategies accordingly. Almodovar notes that the era of extremely low interest rates has concluded, bringing notable implications for the housing market and broader economy. Historically, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage hovered around 6% since 1990, only dropping below 5% after Federal Reserve interventions during financial crises. The pandemic saw dramatic dips below 3% because of aggressive quantitative easing, which ceased when the Fed stopped buying mortgage-backed securities and embarked on QT, causing rates to surge above 6% since September 2022. She explains that despite the fundamental connection between mortgage rates and the 10-year Treasury yield, mortgage investments entail additional risks, thus the persistent spread can remain wide, keeping upward pressure on mortgage rates."

        "summary": "The article \"Cut the Price and They Will Come: New-Vehicle Sales Jump amid Big Discounts and Incentives, as Inventory Balloons\" on Wolf Street by Wolf Richter discusses the current surge in U.S. new-vehicle sales driven by large discounts and incentives offered by dealerships to attract customers amid growing inventory levels. Despite these incentives boosting sales, prices remain high and have not been reduced to fully reflect the increased supply. In \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET,\" it is noted that in November, new-vehicle sales increased by 10% year-over-year to 1.40 million, with retail sales also up 10% to 1.15 million units, achieving the highest annual sales rate since May 2021. This improvement in sales reflects a recovery in inventories and competitive price-cutting strategies by automakers, although long-term unit sales have stagnated over the past 25 years, with brands like Tesla and Hyundai-Kia gaining market share. \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET\" also highlights that automakers like Ford and Stellantis have implemented aggressive incentives to boost sales of overstocked models, leading to reduced prices. Inventory levels have spiked due to prior high prices, prompting Ford to report a 14% sales increase and introduce a new pricing strategy for its 2025 F-series, while Stellantis increased incentives based on dealer feedback to manage excess inventory. Despite greater incentives and inventory numbers, transaction prices and profitability are anticipated to moderate, with the Consumer Price Index for new vehicles gradually declining, suggesting slow affordability improvements in the market. These developments are expected to maintain sales momentum as prices stabilize, potentially returning to pre-pandemic sales figures."

        "summary": "The article \"Underlying Job Market Dynamics Begin to Retighten. The Fed Is Already Backpedaling on the Pace and Depth of Rate Cuts\" from Wolf Street highlights a significant upswing in the labor market, as evidenced by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS). October saw a marked increase in job openings and voluntary quits, reflecting worker confidence and available opportunities, alongside a substantial decrease in layoffs. These trends indicate a strengthening labor market, contrasting with earlier circumstances affected by the Boeing strike and hurricanes, which had temporarily skewed job data. Job openings have surpassed pre-pandemic levels, and the ratio of openings to unemployed persons suggests robust labor demand. However, hiring experienced a slight dip, calling for cautious optimism. These dynamics have prompted the Federal Reserve to reconsider its aggressive strategy for interest rate cuts, as the empirical data points to a healthier labor market than previously perceived. The significant jump in voluntary quits indicates renewed confidence among workers and potential labor force mobility, possibly leading to a re-heating of the market. Overall, the decreasing layoffs show stability as employers retain their workforce, urging the Fed, under Jerome Powell's leadership, to take a balanced approach to support employment gains while avoiding economic overheating."

        "summary": "A Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter outlines the surge in U.S. factory construction spending, reflecting a strategic shift in manufacturing strategies and government policies. The section \"Factory Construction Spending Soars to New Record\" highlights a 16% year-over-year increase and a 242% rise since 2019, driven by corporate shifts and incentives under Trump's tariffs and Biden's taxpayer-funded policies promoting domestic manufacturing. In \"Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET,\" manufacturing plant investments reached a record $21.1 billion in October, with a focus on automated facilities for high-value goods like semiconductors, supported by the CHIPS Act's substantial funding. The cost of setting up such plants exceeds construction expenses, indicating rapid expansion with projected $234 billion spending by 2024. In \"The Big Rethink,\" Biden's debt-funded incentives have fueled investments, especially in states like Texas and Arizona, though these could phase out if Trump reinstates tariffs. Companies are rethinking dependencies on China due to strained relations and pandemic disruptions, aligning with Trump's China-hawk stance which Biden largely maintains. \"Factories become a bigger part of overall construction spending\" reports that factory construction's share of total spending almost doubled since 2019, pointing to a shift without construction cost inflation. \"The first money of the CHIPS Act starts flowing in December\" reveals that Intel, as a key beneficiary, starts receiving funds, marking the initial disbursement under the Act. Lastly, in \"Industrial robots cost the same anywhere,\" the article emphasizes that the uniform cost of industrial robots supports U.S. manufacturing of complex products like vehicles and semiconductors, minimizing labor costs and focusing on high-value production over manual labor."

Fastest 2-Year Spike Ever\" from Wolf Street, written by Wolf Richter, discusses the significant increase in the delinquency rate of Office Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (CMBS) to 10.4%, which nearly matches levels seen during the 2008 financial crisis. The section by Wolf Richter highlights that this spike is the fastest recorded in two years, pointing to a deep depression in the office real estate sector, exacerbated by high vacancy rates and insufficient rental income. Many landlords struggle to meet mortgage obligations, leading to defaults, while the structural issue of an oversupply of old office buildings hinders refinancing efforts as these buildings fail to generate adequate income, and market prices fall. This is detailed in the section for Wolf Street, which notes that loan restructuring and term extensions have been attempted, yet these solutions only delay the problem. The article mentions efforts to convert older office spaces into residential units as a partial solution, but these represent a small fraction of available office spaces, and the vast vacancy remains largely unaddressed. Fortunately, the US banking system remains relatively insulated, as risks are widely distributed among global investors and firms, with resilience shown by the fact no banks have failed under this pressure despite some banks having high exposure. The article provides a comprehensive overview of the significant challenges within the office sector of commercial real estate."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter highlights the escalating concerns of the U.S. federal government's financial situation, focusing on the \"Federal Government Interest-Payments-to-Tax-Receipts Ratio Spikes\" section where the ratio reached a staggering 37.8% in Q3, the highest since 1996, indicating that a substantial portion of tax income for the budget is being absorbed by interest payments. This rise in payments, detailed in \"Interest payments have surged because\u2026,\" is due to ballooning national debt and rising interest rates, with the debt having soared by $2.1 trillion in 2024 alone to a total of $36.1 trillion, worsening the debt-to-GDP ratio to 120.8%. The article also elaborates that the fiscal imbalance has been fueled by historically low interest rates from 2008 to 2021, which led to extensive debt. While market conditions like capital gains taxes impact tax receipts and fluctuate with market performance, long-term growth in tax receipts is driven by factors like higher incomes and corporate profits, underscored by inflation which increases taxable incomes. The \"By Wolf Richter for Wolf Street\" section discusses how government interest payments increased by $37 billion year-over-year, a 15% jump to $279 billion, while tax receipts grew by $29 billion or 4.1% to $740 billion in the same period, particularly emphasizing how the market downturn in 2022 impacted tax receipts. The article cautions that without addressing this imbalance through potential legislative action or enduring higher inflation and interest rates, the financial strain on the government could continue to increase, potentially impacting the broader economy."

        "summary": "The article from Wolf Street, authored by Wolf Richter, discusses the concerning trend of inflation re-accelerating despite the decrease in gasoline prices, primarily driven by a surge in the costs of core services, which have hit a seven-month high. As the introduction mentions, this suggests persistent inflationary pressures that remain despite lower energy costs, leading the Federal Reserve to consider a more cautious stance on the pace of interest rate cuts. According to the section \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET,\" inflation is predominantly seen in the services sector, which has become persistent and is accelerating. This sector significantly influences consumer spending with notable increases in durable goods prices for the second consecutive month, although falling gasoline prices and slight food price increases have partially offset this trend. These changes are measured using the PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) price index, a critical measure for the Federal Reserve's inflation targets. The article details that several major inflation indicators, including the overall and core PCE indices, accelerated year-over-year in October, with the durable goods index trending towards less negative territory, indicating possible inflationary trends. As outlined in the section \"Core services showed significant inflation acceleration,\" core services demonstrated a 4.4% annual increase in prices in October, marking the fastest rise since May and exerting a substantial impact on overall inflation measures. This category includes areas like housing, healthcare, and transportation while excluding energy services. Lastly, as discussed in the section titled \"Inflation in durable goods...\" despite traditionally facing price reductions due to efficiencies and offshoring, durable goods have faced inflation due to pandemic-driven demand spikes and subsequent supply chain issues. The overall PCE, including volatile food and energy prices, rose 2.3% year-over-year, even with significant energy price declines. This divergence between the overall PCE and core PCE indices highlights the varying influences of housing and transportation prices on inflation trends, where energy prices affect overall but not core PCE measures."

        "summary": "In the Wolf Street article \"Inventory of New Single-Family Houses Jumps to Highest since 2007. Unsold Spec Houses Jump to Highest since 2009 as Sales Suddenly Plunge,\" author Wolf Richter discusses the challenges facing homebuilders due to a substantial rise in unsold new single-family homes, the highest since 2007, with speculative (spec) houses reaching their peak unsold inventory since 2009. The increased supply, coupled with declining sales, has industry experts suggesting potential price cuts to address the imbalance. In the section titled \"Inventory of New Single-Family Houses,\" it is highlighted that builders are producing more affordable homes and offering incentives amid decreasing demand for existing homes, which has resulted in inventory accumulation. Despite a 9.3% year-over-year increase in new home inventory and a significant 53% rise in unsold completed spec houses, builders are hopeful that price reductions will address price dislocations. \"Sales of completed houses\" in October dropped significantly, with a 25% month-to-month decline, yet new single-family house sales across all construction stages rose slightly by 3.3% year-to-date, implying selective market resilience. The \"Prices, Mortgage-Rate Buydowns, and Incentives\" section indicates fluctuating median contract prices for new homes, with a noted spike in October to $437,300, following a similar trend in 2022. This doesn't fully reflect builders' adjustments in costs, such as incentives and mortgage-rate buydowns that year. \"Prices of New Houses Versus Existing Houses\" shows new homes historically being priced higher than existing ones by 10% to 30%, with recent market dynamics involving incentive programs altering this trend, resulting in new homes gaining preference over existing homes whose sales have plummeted to 1995 levels. This shift has sustained new home sales despite the challenges."

The section titled \"Overall Fuel Economy\" explains that the fuel economy of passenger vehicles in the US reached a record 28.0 MPG for the 2024 model year, with the \"Car SUV\" segment seeing a remarkable 47% improvement since 2019, driven largely by EVs like the Tesla Model Y. In \"The Horsepower War,\" the article notes a sharp increase in average vehicle horsepower, citing a new peak of 267 horsepower for 2024, largely due to advancements like fuel injection and electronic engine management. Electric vehicles, alongside potent electric pickup trucks such as the Ford F-150 Lightning and Tesla Cybertruck, are expected to further drive this horsepower escalation as EV market share grows, having reached 9.0% in the third quarter. \"Automakers made huge progress in ICE technology\" explores the continuous advancements in ICE efficiency, with increased specific power and reduced fuel consumption exemplified by models like the 2024 Ford Mustang. However, as section \"But Power, luxury, and fancy stuff weigh more\" reveals, this progression comes with increased vehicle weights, with the average weight reaching 4,419 pounds, particularly in pickup trucks and electric models. Lastly, \"And it costs a lot more\u2026\" delves into vehicle pricing, illustrating the divergent trends between vehicles like the Ford F-150 XLT, which has seen significant price reductions, and the Toyota Camry LE, now sold only as a hybrid with a notable price increase for its 2025 model. The article provides a comprehensive view of how consumer preferences and technological advances are reshaping the automotive landscape, emphasizing a shift toward high-performance vehicles with improved fuel efficiency."

        "summary": "In Q3 2024, the Federal Reserve reported significant operating and \"unrealized\" losses, reflecting a departure from the previous benefits of Quantitative Easing. Operating losses totaled $19.9 billion, driven by higher interest expenses outpacing income from a shrinking portfolio of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. Over the first three quarters, operating losses showed improvement at $63.1 billion, down from $88.1 billion in the previous year, projecting an annual total below $85 billion. \u201cUnrealized losses\u201d on securities reduced to $818 billion by September 30 from a mid-year peak of $1.302 trillion, although they might edge back towards $1 trillion as yields increase. These represent the gap between amortized costs and current market values, expected to close as securities mature. Since the Fed creates its own money and can't become insolvent, losses primarily impact the Treasury Department, which ceased receiving remittances. Transitioning to positive income could take several years, resuming remittances thereafter. Historically, QE yielded $1.1 trillion in remittances from 2008 to Q3 2022, but current challenges underscore the risk associated with rising rates."

This change has resulted from the Federal Reserve's revised approach to rate cuts amid persistent inflation concerns and strong economic performance. As detailed in the first section, the cautious stance on interest rate reductions has heightened the dollar's attractiveness to investors. Subsequently, the US dollar index reached a two-year high, driven by policy rate changes from central banks, as outlined in the section by Wolf Richter. The article further explains how this policy divergence, notably between the Fed and other central banks like the European Central Bank (ECB), Bank of Canada, and Bank of Japan, has widened interest rate spreads. As a result, currencies such as the Euro and Canadian Dollar have declined notably against the dollar, exacerbated by aggressive rate cuts from their central banks. In contrast, the Yen has suffered due to the Bank of Japan's less robust monetary tightening. The final section focuses on concerns regarding the broader economic implications of fluctuating currencies, as central banks navigate complex environments where interest rate strategies significantly influence currency values. While these disparities in monetary policies might bolster the US dollar's strength, they could simultaneously amplify economic challenges for trading partners with weaker currencies, thereby highlighting the interplay between monetary policy, currency valuation, and global market dynamics."

This buyers\u2019 strike continues in November and December, as mortgage applications have decreased significantly, with a 50% drop from 2019 levels. Supply is second highest for any October in 7 years, behind only 2018, with unsold inventory reaching 1.37 million homes, marking a significant 19% increase from the previous year. Days on the market rise, with homes taking an average of 58 days to sell in October. The 7% mortgages are back, with the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate surpassing 7%, impacting October's mortgage applications and, consequently, closed sales. Home prices vary widely by metro, with some areas experiencing significant fluctuations, such as Austin seeing a 20.4% drop from its peak, while New York City alone reached new highs among the largest housing market bubbles. The National Association of Realtors (NAR) blames everything except the problem: too-high prices, attributing declining demand to factors like limited inventory and rising mortgage rates, despite commercial real estate and homebuilders reducing prices and offering incentives to stimulate sales. The article concludes by highlighting demand destruction by region, noting variations across the US, with the North and Midwest seeing increased sales rates, the South showing robust demand, and the West experiencing moderate growth."

The ECB\u2019s \"Negotiated Wages\" index, reflecting upcoming wage hikes from collective bargaining agreements, spiked by 5.4% year-over-year in Q3, contrary to expectations of wage moderation that would support disinflation and justify rate cuts. While higher wages can boost demand, they pose an inflationary risk, especially in the services sector. Services inflation, despite reduced energy prices, remains high with a CPI rate of 4.0% in October, well above the ECB's 2% target. Core CPI, excluding volatile items, has steadily risen, further complicating the ECB's task of balancing policy actions to control inflation without exacerbating it. The ECB's balance sheet, now at \u20ac6.38 trillion, reflects progress in QT, yet the option to adjust rates remains should inflation persist."

Under \"Subprime doesn\u2019t mean low income, it means bad credit,\" the article clarifies that subprime credit pertains to bad credit rather than low income and highlights the misreporting by some media on the New York Fed's \"Transition into Delinquency\" as an end-of-quarter delinquency rate, when it is actually an annual measure of delinquency inflow. In \"Credit Card Balances are a partial measure spending, not of debt,\" the piece discusses how credit card balances, at $1.17 trillion in Q3 after a $24 billion increase, mostly reflect consumer spending rather than debt due to practices like paying off balances in full. The section, \"Income rose 142%, credit balances only 53% in 20 years,\" points out that over two decades, disposable income has risen by 142%, while credit balances have grown by only 53%, reducing the debt-to-income ratio substantially. Finally, \"Banks are eager to expand credit\" captures how banks are actively expanding credit availability with a $269 billion increase in credit limits, driven by the opening of new accounts and limit raises, culminating in a $3.82 trillion in available unused credit, suggesting banks' aggressive push to extend credit access. The article is part of a more extensive series exploring consumer credit dynamics, including auto loans, housing debt, and household debt trends."

        "summary": "Amidst concerns about the escalating US national debt, foreign investors continue to be drawn to US Treasury debt due to the attractive yields compared to their domestic options, as highlighted in the section US Treasury Debt Held by Foreign Investors: Ravenous Appetite for Juicy Yields, Juicy Compared to their Stuff at Home. This robust demand, which saw a $170 billion increase in foreign holdings in September, accumulating to a record $8.67 trillion, is primarily driven by higher US Treasury yields like the 10-year yield at 4.42%, which are much more appealing than those in countries like Germany and Japan. The increase in foreign holdings to 24.5% of total Treasury debt underscores the strong global demand, with major financial centers such as London and Luxembourg accounting for a significant portion, as exhibited by their $92 billion increase in September. However, in the section Euro Area v. China + Hong Kong, it is noted that China and Hong Kong have reduced their US Treasury holdings by 0.5% in September and 5.3% over the past year, while the Euro Area significantly boosted its holdings by $99 billion in September and has experienced a 234% surge since 2012. Japan's holdings decreased slightly, influenced by the depreciating yen and limited monetary tightening. Meanwhile, the United Kingdom increased its holdings by 2.8% in September and 26.5% over the past year, with Canada's holdings more than tripling since March 2021. Taiwan and India also saw notable increases in their holdings, while Brazil's remained steady compared to 2012 levels, illustrating diverse international investment strategies in US Treasuries."

        "summary": "In the third quarter of 2024, the auto-loan market, delineated in sections such as Auto-Loan Balances, Burden, Subprime & Prime, and Subprime Dealer America's Car-Mart in Q3 2024, reflects significant stress for subprime borrowers despite the overall stability in the prime sector. Auto-loan balances reached $1.64 trillion, a marginal increase, hinting at a low annual growth rate due to a rise in cash purchases, with 20% for new vehicles and 64% for used, as consumers cope with high-interest rates. Despite an impressive 135% surge in auto-loan balances over 20 years, primarily due to price hikes rather than unit sales increases, new vehicle prices in 2023 slightly reduced, affecting loan growth. The burden of auto loans relative to disposable income showed improvement as vehicle prices declined and incomes rose, decreasing the debt-to-income ratio to 7.5% by Q1 2024. Subprime lending, inherently risky, especially in the used vehicle sector, saw strains, amplified by falling vehicle prices and rising interest rates, forcing some dealer chains into bankruptcy. America's Car-Mart exemplified the subprime difficulties with a substantial drop in stock prices due to serious financial issues. In terms of delinquency rates, the total 60-plus day rate was at 1.55% in September, reflecting stable prime rates within 0.28% to 0.35% this year and unchanged subprime rates at 6.1%, indicating stabilization from earlier reckless lending practices. Prime delinquencies, resilient even during recessions, highlight a strong financial status, contrasting with the troubled subprime sector amid a shifting economic landscape."

Condo Prices Hit 3-Year Low\" by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street, it is reported that Canada's housing market is experiencing diverse trends across different cities. In October 2024, Toronto saw a significant 19% decline in single-family home prices from peak levels, returning to October 2021 values, while cities like Montreal, Quebec City, Edmonton, and Winnipeg maintained near-record highs, highlighting regional variations. In the \"By\" section, home sales rose by 7.7% from the previous month and 30% year-over-year, while new listings fell by 3.5% and inventory increased by 11.4% year-over-year, leading to reduced supply. Single-family home prices experienced a 0.9% drop from September and a 2.1% year-over-year decline, marking the sixth consecutive annual decline with a 17.4% decrease from March 2022. Condo prices hit a low since December 2021 with a 0.8% decrease from September and a 4.4% year-over-year decline, reflecting a similar downward trend across property types.

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter, titled \"Here Come the HELOCs: Mortgages, the Burden of Housing Debt, Serious Delinquencies, and Foreclosures in Q3 2024,\" discusses the financial landscape of Q3 2024, focusing on mortgage balances, HELOCs, and housing debt burdens. In the \"Mortgage balances in Q3\" section, Richter notes a slight increase of 0.57% in mortgage balances, attributing the slowdown to potential homebuyers opting for renting due to high mortgage rates and stagnant home prices. This trend has shifted consumer preferences towards renting. In the \"HELOC balances surge\" section, Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOC) balances rose significantly, up 1.8% from Q2 and 11.9% year-over-year, driven by homeowners choosing HELOCs over refinancing due to higher mortgage rates. Despite the increase, HELOCs remain historically low as a percentage of total mortgage balances. The \"The burden of housing debt\" section reveals that housing debts increased by 0.60%, but faster growth in disposable income reduced the debt-to-income ratio to a low 59.5%, suggesting consumers face a relatively low debt burden compared to past eras. In the \"Serious delinquencies remain low\" section, serious mortgage delinquencies are at a low of 0.57%, with HELOC delinquencies at 0.36%, the lowest since 2006. Rising home prices have helped prevent widespread delinquencies, even during strong labor markets with falling home prices. Finally, the \"The frying-pan pattern of foreclosures\" section highlights that pandemic-era relief programs significantly reduced foreclosures, with Q3 2024 numbers at 41,520, much lower than pre-pandemic levels, indicating the sustained influence of these relief efforts."

The report reveals revisions for October showing an acceleration in price increases, particularly a rise in services PPI that led to a core PPI increase of 3.1% year-over-year. Though energy and food prices saw a month-to-month drop, the overall PPI rose by 2.4% year-over-year, mainly due to the increase in services PPI. It is pointed out that inflation in services has become more persistent, with the PPI for final demand services climbing to a 3.2% annualized rate in October, influenced by areas like portfolio management and airline passenger services. The consistent upward trend in service prices is further underscored by revised data from past months. On the other hand, the \"finished core goods\" PPI stayed relatively stable due to declining goods prices, with a modest rise to 1.5% annualized in October. This stability, coupled with the decrease in energy prices, has helped curb overall inflation impacts. However, the persistent rise in core PPI by 3.1% month-to-month annualized in October highlights ongoing inflationary pressures, despite energy prices aiding in moderating these trends as the overall PPI climbed sharply to 2.4%."

In the \"Household Debt\" section, it is noted that while total household debt has increased by $71 billion to $17.9 trillion, driven by higher borrowing capacity and rising costs of major purchases, incomes have also risen significantly, leading to improved debt management. In \"The relative burden of household debt\" section, the debt-to-disposable income ratio is described as historically low at 82%, reflecting stable consumer financial health compared to the pre-Financial Crisis era when consumers were over-leveraged. The \"Serious delinquencies form frying-pan pattern\" section highlights that despite a small number of individuals, termed \"Drunken Sailors,\" who struggle with credit, the overall delinquency rate for household debts beyond 90 days is at a historic low of 1.8%. \"Foreclosures from frying-pan pattern\" reveals a decline in foreclosures, down to 41,520 in Q3, thanks to higher home prices which allow debt-burdened homeowners to clear debts through sales, avoiding negative credit impact unless there is a sharp drop in home prices and high unemployment. In the \"Third-party collections not even in a frying-pan pattern\" section, it is observed that the percentage of consumers with third-party collections has reached a record low of 4.60%. Lastly, the \"Consumers with bankruptcies form frying-pan pattern\" section notes a significant decrease in bankruptcy filings to 126,140 in Q3, suggesting a minimal risk of sudden increases in financial distress.

In \"Core services\" CPI, a slight deceleration in October contrasts with a minor acceleration in the 3-month annualized rate. Meanwhile, \"The housing components of core services\" highlights a significant rise in the Owners' Equivalent of Rent to 4.9% in October. The \"Durable goods\" section explains how used vehicle prices unexpectedly rose, disrupting a cooling trend in core CPI, while new vehicle prices remained stable despite inventory surpluses. \"Food Inflation\" notes a stabilization yet high level of food inflation for groceries, with a 26% rise since January 2020, showing varied trends across food categories. In \"Apparel and footwear,\" there was an October decline in CPI, marking stability year-over-year. The \"Energy\" section discusses the flat CPI due to a 0.9% decrease in gasoline prices, with divergent trends across different energy categories, influencing consumer expenses.

The article is divided into sections titled \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET\" and \"The 30 Most Splendid Housing Bubbles in America.\" It starts by discussing low demand and high supply in the housing market, magnified by elevated mortgage rates despite a rate cut, around 7%, deterring buyers. Homebuilders have gained market share by reducing prices and offering incentives, making renting more attractive. This reduced demand leads to price drops in major cities, with declines from 2022 peaks in 19 out of 30 metropolitan areas, indicating a shift in housing dynamics. The section \"The 30 Most Splendid Housing Bubbles in America\" analyzes Zillow's Home Value Index data, noting that significant price shifts arose from changes in federal monetary policy and mortgage rates since 2022. It focuses on metros with peak home values above $300,000, identifying key markets like Austin, San Francisco, Phoenix, and San Antonio as experiencing notable declines. Austin faces the steepest drop at 20.4%. The section underscores variability in housing price trends due to Federal Reserve policy shifts, showing these bubbles' volatility with recent regional downturns despite past rapid gains."

There Were Some Twists\" by Wolf Richter analyzes recent shifts in pricing strategies by major automakers Ford and Toyota. The article highlights how Ford has cut the MSRP of its 2025 F-150 XLT trucks, marking a rare reduction following years of significant increases, with the base model's price reduced by over $2,000. However, this only partially compensates for the previous cumulative 35% price hikes over the past three years. On the other hand, Toyota has discontinued the base Camry LE model in favor of the Camry LE Hybrid as the new entry-level option, effectively raising the base price by nearly $2,000. These changes occur amidst a general decline in new vehicle prices over the past year, driven by accumulated inventories and consumer resistance. Both automakers' pricing adjustments mirror broader trends in the industry towards fuel efficiency and affordability. The discussion also touches on the challenges faced by the long-term data in the Wolf Street price index as these shifts alter the model structures and features, and despite actual prices paid by consumers often differing from the MSRP, it remains a consistent measure for tracking historical vehicle pricing trends. The article underscores the automotive industry's need to adapt pricing strategies in response to market dynamics and the consumer price index for new vehicles."

It highlights that corporate balance sheets and cash flows are channeling substantial money into the economy through significant investment in AI, acting as a stimulant that may postpone recessionary pressures. The article draws parallels with the Dotcom Bubble, noting that the present wave of AI investment, involving major corporations such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Tesla, is boosting economic activity. This involves AI-related spending categorized into operational expenses that lower earnings, and capital expenditures like AI servers that impact future earnings. Smaller companies, utilities, and startups are also contributing to this economic surge. However, the article warns that when AI investments inevitably slow, akin to the Dotcom Bust, it could lead to job losses and reduced spending, potentially causing a recession. This economic pattern suggests that while aggressive corporate spending during the AI surge is fostering vibrant economic activity, it poses risks if spending decreases, potentially causing far-reaching effects on the economy similarly to those witnessed after the Dotcom era."

        "summary": "The article \"With Home Prices Way Too High, More People Profit from Arbitraging Vast Cost Difference between Renting and Buying\" by Wolf Richter from Wolf Street discusses how the high costs associated with homeownership are encouraging more people to rent. The section titled \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET\" reveals that Fannie Mae\u2019s National Housing Survey shows a record-high preference for renting over buying at 36%, surpassing levels seen during the 2010-2011 housing bust. This shift is largely due to soaring home prices since 2020, which make buying a home less affordable monthly compared to renting. The section \"The cost of buying a home significantly...\" highlights how additional financial burdens such as mortgage rates, property taxes, and insurance premiums make homeownership costlier than renting. This realization of financial disadvantage has led to a notable decline in home-buying demand, akin to levels last seen in 1995, while inventories of homes have begun to increase. Lastly, the section \"Renting provides more financial flexibility...\" explains that renting offers more flexibility and minimizes the risk of loss from potential declines in property values, seen in some markets. Many are choosing to rent to avoid the hefty expenses of homeownership and possible home value depreciation, especially in light of economic challenges like Quantitative Tightening, which maintains high mortgage rates."

        "summary": "The article from Wolf Street, authored by Wolf Richter, discusses the Federal Reserve's Quantitative Tightening (QT) program, highlighting a significant reduction in the Fed's balance sheet to $6.99 trillion as of October 2023. This represents a contraction of $1.97 trillion since its peak, effectively reversing 41% of the asset expansion that occurred during the pandemic's Quantitative Easing (QE). The article delves into the \"QT assets by category,\" noting a $24 billion decrease in Treasury securities to $4.34 trillion, marking a reduction of 44% of the pandemic-era additions. The roll-off of these securities, mainly Treasury notes and bonds, has a monthly cap of $25 billion and is slightly adjusted by inflation protections on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). Moreover, the Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) portfolio decreased by $16 billion to $2.27 trillion, a 35% rollback of the pandemic QE additions, largely due to mortgage payoffs amid declining home sales and refinancing. The Federal Reserve is contemplating outright sales of agency MBS to accelerate reductions. In the section about \"Bank liquidity facilities,\" the article indicates that the Discount Window's balance remained at $1.6 billion in October 2023, significantly down from its peak of $153 billion during the March 2023 bank panic. The stigma and cost associated with the Discount Window limit its usage despite Chairman Jerome Powell's encouragement. Meanwhile, the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) reduced its balance to $56 billion, the lowest since its peak of $168 billion when banks initially exploited it for arbitrage. The Federal Reserve closed this arbitrage loophole in January 2024 and plans to let the BTFP expire by March 2024, targeting full liquidation by March 2025."

QT Continues\" on Wolf Street highlights the Federal Reserve's decision to reduce interest rates by 25 basis points, setting the top range at 4.75%. This move, covered in the section by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET, reflects prior signals from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) about a modest rate cut as opposed to a larger reduction. The Fed's decision follows feedback from revised economic indicators such as GDP and inflation, alongside impacts from the October jobs report, which were influenced temporarily by strikes and natural disasters. The section \"What changed in the FOMC\u2019s statement\" notes the FOMC's statement now perceiving inflation and employment risks as balanced, a shift from the prior stance. This section also emphasizes the continued growth of economic activity, slight easing of labor market conditions, and an unemployment rate that remains low despite slight increases. The Committee reduced the federal funds rate target to 4.5%-4.75%, a more modest decrease than initially implemented, highlighting their cautious approach to adjusting rates based on incoming data. The Fed continues its quantitative tightening process by reducing its assets in Treasury securities and maintains the dual mandate goals of maximizing employment and achieving a 2% inflation target, as stated during a \"no-dot-plot\" meeting where detailed economic projections were not disclosed. These strategic moves reflect the Committee's nuanced outlook and future policy adjustments to sustain economic stability."

        "summary": "The article \"Longer-term Treasury Yields & Mortgage Rates Explode, Yield Curve Un-Inverts Further as Bond Market Gets Spooked\" by Wolf Richter on Wolf Street discusses the recent rise in longer-term Treasury yields and mortgage rates, which have had significant impacts on the housing market and the broader financial landscape. Treasury yields, particularly the 10-year, rose to 4.46%, up by 81 basis points since a mid-September Federal Reserve rate cut. This increase, alongside rises in the 30-year and 2-year yields, has caused the yield curve to un-invert after being inverted since 2022, as longer-term yields surpass short-term ones. Consequently, mortgage rates linked to the 10-year yield have risen to 7.13%, leading to reduced mortgage applications and decreased demand for homes, thereby exacerbating challenges within the struggling housing market. These developments have spooked the bond market, creating financial losses for bondholders due to plunging bond prices and increased nervousness and volatility. Despite initial expectations of falling rates, the current trajectory raises concerns about further challenges for homebuyers and sellers, impacting housing affordability and financial stability."

        "summary": "The article \"Inventory of Existing Homes in Texas Balloons to Highest in Many Years, Prices Drift Lower but Are Still Way Too High\" by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET discusses the rising inventory of unsold homes in Texas, indicating that high home prices are keeping potential buyers at bay. Under the section titled \"Median Days on the Market drag out,\" it notes that the typical time a listing spends on the market has increased to 61 days, suggesting that sellers, realizing the challenging market conditions, are either adjusting prices downwards or leaving properties unsold for longer durations. In \"Inventories are piling up because prices are too high. But they\u2019re coming down,\" the article highlights the escalation of active listings, with prices still deemed excessively high despite a slight downward trend. Prices must become more realistic to allow market movement. \"Price reductions trim too-high listing price\" notes a significant number of price reductions, the third-highest since 2016, signaling that more considerable cuts are necessary to spark interest in an oversupplied market. The major Texas markets are experiencing varied degrees of price declines in closed sales prices, with Austin seeing a 20% drop from its June 2022 peak, Dallas-Fort Worth down 4.4%, Houston down 1.9% from its peak but still gaining year-over-year, and San Antonio experiencing a 6.8% dip from its peak, all reflecting the ongoing challenges in the housing market as sellers grapple with a mismatch between buyer expectations and existing price points."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article titled \"Social Security Update Fiscal 2024: Trust Fund, Income, Outgo, and Deficit\" by Wolf Richter examines the current status of the Social Security Trust Fund, formally known as the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund (OASI), amidst its fiscal 2024 performance. The social security contributions rose by 5.6% due to higher employment and wages, and taxation of benefits increased by $3 billion, resulting in a record income of $1.21 trillion. However, this income growth was outpaced by an 8.5% increase in expenses, which reached $1.30 trillion, primarily due to rising benefit payments driven by more retirees and cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs). This led to the Trust Fund facing a $91.5 billion deficit, marking its largest shortfall to date after successive annual deficits since 2018, which decreased its balance to $2.58 trillion. The section on \"How the Trust Fund invested the $2.58 trillion\" explains that these assets are conservatively placed in special-issue Treasury securities preventing market volatility-induced losses. The \"Fed\u2019s interest rate repression contributed to the deficit\" section further explains how low interest rates negatively impacted earnings, which in 2024 were $63 billion compared to a potential $107 billion if rates had stayed at 4.5%. As these low-yield securities mature, the average interest rate rose to 2.52%, with better rates anticipated as the 10-year yield is now at 4.3%. Meanwhile, the \"Shifting to shorter-term securities\" section discusses the decrease in average maturity periods to 5.19 years, aligning with the SSA's strategy to benefit from future high-yield securities soon. The \"Tweaking the plan is necessary\" section argues that despite the Trust Fund's deficit, equivalent actions can still stabilize the system without drastic consequences. Failure to act could result in the fund depleting within a decade, possibly necessitating legislative changes or budgetary supplements. Although prior Congressional proposals to resolve these issues have stagnated, minor adjustments have previously proven sufficient to address financial pressures effectively."

        "summary": "The article \"Office CMBS Delinquency Rate Spikes to 9.4%, Highest Since Worst Months after the Financial Crisis\" by Wolf Richter on Wolf Street highlights the severe challenges facing commercial real estate (CRE) in the office sector. The delinquency rate for Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (CMBS) has surged to 9.4%, a level not seen since the aftermath of the financial crisis. This increase points to heightened distress driven by remote work trends and urban dynamics. As a result, the industry is cautiously adopting a \"survive till 2025\" outlook, hoping for stabilization despite deep uncertainties about market recovery. Over the past two years, some older office buildings have lost up to 70% of their value as landlords struggle to collect sufficient rent to cover loan interest, exacerbating mortgage delinquencies. Refinancing maturing loans remains a challenge, contributing to the spike in delinquency rates. Although there are rumors about the market bottoming out, the continuous rise in CMBS delinquencies suggests deeper structural issues, such as vacancy rates ranging from 25% to 36% in major markets, often due to overbuilding and changing work habits. Delinquent office buildings, where interest payments are overdue after a 30-day grace period, typically result in significant losses for CMBS holders. The CRE industry hopes for interest rate cuts to ease floating-rate loan payments, aiding a \"survive till 2025\" strategy. Nonetheless, this does not resolve core challenges of declining demand and overvaluation of mostly vacant office towers, many of which were refinanced at inflated valuations pre-pandemic, now posing issues for lenders and investors."

Under \"Ditching Stocks,\" Berkshire significantly reduced its stock holdings by net selling $34.6 billion worth of stocks, including a substantial sale of Apple shares, paring down its stake from 908 million shares two years ago to about 300 million shares, while also reducing its Bank of America shares. Despite these reductions, Apple remains its largest investment, valued at $69.9 billion. The \"Ditching Bonds\" section reveals Berkshire decreased its bond holdings by about 33%, including a major reduction in U.S. Treasury and government bonds, with much of these funds reinvested in U.S. Treasury bills. The \"Ditching Share Buybacks\" part explains that Berkshire did not repurchase its own shares in Q3, indicating Buffett's belief that better investment opportunities will arise. This cautious strategic shift establishes a substantial cash and Treasury bill reserve, totaling $325 billion, enabling Berkshire to capitalize on future undervalued market opportunities and ensuring liquidity and low credit risk. Despite declining T-bill yields, this reserve generated approximately $3 billion in interest income in Q3, surpassing other major operational incomes of the company, reflecting Buffett's prudent approach amidst potential market turbulence."

SOFR & TGCR Spreads Begin to Move,\" written by Wolf Richter, explores the implications of the Federal Reserve's ongoing Quantitative Tightening (QT) measures on market liquidity. The recent dip in Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreements (ON RRPs) to $155 billion marks a significant liquidity reduction from its December 2022 peak of $2.4 trillion, reflecting a normalization of liquidity levels as money market funds, worth a total of $6.5 trillion, relocate their excess cash to higher-yield options like Treasury bills or the repo market. Despite concerns from Wall Street regarding potential disruptions below the $700 billion threshold, financial stability persists even as ON RRPs approach zero, indicating successful liquidity management. In the article's section \"Temporary rate pressures can be price signals that help markets redistribute liquidity: Fed\u2019s Logan,\" it highlights how minor fluctuations in indices such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) and the Treasury General Collateral Repo (TGCR), experienced at particular times like month-end, are signs of excess liquidity diminishing. Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan emphasizes these pressures can serve as useful price signals, assisting in redistributing liquidity efficiently and maintaining robust reserve balances, which remain unchanged at $3.24 trillion since the QT began in mid-2022. This ongoing adjustment reflects the Federal Reserve's strategy to recalibrate liquidity levels in the financial system, aiming for efficient balance sheet sizing and effective liquidity allocation, while tolerating temporary rate pressures as part of the process."

The section \"Hurricanes Helene & Milton and the Boeing Strike Make Mess of Jobs Report\" explains that major hurricanes and the Boeing strike significantly skewed October's nonfarm payrolls, causing temporary employment drops. Despite disruptions, overall payrolls increased by 12,000 jobs, with wages experiencing a notable surge, suggesting inflationary pressures on employers. \"By Wolf Richter for Wolf Street\" notes complications in isolating specific impacts of events like hurricanes on employment data, particularly in transportation equipment manufacturing, where unemployment rose. The \"The bond market figured it out too\" section details the bond market's reaction, with the 10-year Treasury yield rising to 4.35% in anticipation of inflationary effects from rising wages and the return of Boeing employees with substantial pay raises. The article also addresses the broader employment landscape and labor force growth, highlighting a low national unemployment rate of 4.1% and acknowledging complexities from new immigrant workforce contributions. Overall, while temporary factors disrupted job growth, the wage increases raised inflation concerns, prompting the bond market's response."

This plunge has landed the company on Wolf Street's list of Imploded Stocks, illustrating the volatile nature of AI-driven stock prices.

The 12-month core PCE price index, which the Federal Reserve uses to target a 2% inflation rate, has shown no improvement for five months, maintaining a rise of 2.65% year-over-year as of September, thus indicating persistent inflationary pressures. In another section, September explaine the core PCE price index increased by 3.1% annualized from August, marking the highest month-to-month rise since April, driven by a 3.7% rise in core services and a 4.0% increase in durable goods prices, highlighting short-term inflationary fluctuations more distinctly than longer-term averages. The 3-month core PCE price index rose to 2.35% annualized, evidencing an upward trend in underlying inflation, whereas the 6-month index slowed slightly but stayed above previous year-end levels. The section on durable goods revealed a 4.0% spike in September, reversing prior deflationary trends, primarily due to price hikes in motor vehicles, furnishings, and appliances. Despite the temporary fluctuations, durable goods' 6-month and 12-month indices, though negative, indicated a decreased rate of decline. Lastly, the core services PCE index increased by 3.7% annually, albeit at a decelerated pace from the previous month, while the overall PCE index, including food and energy, rose by 2.1% year-over-year, largely due to a significant fall in energy prices and moderated food cost rises."

This rise in consumption, accounting for 69% of GDP, was especially marked in sectors like motor vehicles. However, this growth period also experienced a substantial rise in government spending, especially in defense, further inflating GDP figures but worsening the national debt through increased expenditure. The trade deficit, which has worsened for three consecutive quarters, negatively impacted GDP growth due to a surge in imports to meet domestic and holiday-related demands. Additionally, private fixed investment slowed, notably in residential investments with a deceleration to 1.3%. Despite some sectors like government spending increasing by 5%, they contributed less to GDP growth compared to consumer spending. Consequently, the debt-to-GDP ratio slightly rose to 120.8% in Q3 as the national debt grew faster than the GDP, highlighting the dichotomy between short-term economic gains and long-term financial stability. These elements collectively reflect the complexities of the economic landscape during this period."

The \"Layoffs & Discharges Jump but Remain Low\" section reveals that layoffs and discharges rose to 1.83 million in September, yet remain low compared to previous decades, possibly due to employers' past experiences with labor shortages. The concluding \"Job Openings Fall\" section points out that job openings declined to 7.44 million, aligning with pre-pandemic peak levels, as the labor force churn from previous years has ceased.

This capital raise comes after the company spent $64 billion on share buybacks between 2013 and 2019, leaving it without the necessary financial cushion in times of need. According to Richter, the company has recorded nearly $32 billion in net losses since 2019 and amassed $58 billion in debt, leading to negative equity. To address this, Boeing announced the issuance of 90 million common shares and $5 billion in mandatory convertible preferred stock, raising $22 billion to repair the damage from past buybacks. However, this will result in a 15% dilution for shareholders, decreasing earnings per share if profitability returns. Boeing's credit rating approaches junk status amid cash flow issues, production problems, and labor strikes, threatening future funding and debt repayment capabilities. Although the equity raise offers temporary relief, core production quality and structural problems persist, emphasizing the detrimental impact of prioritizing financial engineering over engineering expertise."

        "summary": "The article \"Treasury Yield Curve Un-Inversion Hits Milestone on Inflation Fears, Tsunami of Supply, QT. Mortgage Rates Near 7%\" by Wolf Richter discusses the dynamics of the Treasury yield curve, highlighting a significant rise in the 10-year yield by 60 basis points over a five-week period, reaching 4.25% despite the Federal Reserve's 50 basis point rate cut. This increase is driven by inflation fears and a massive supply of Treasuries needed to cover budget deficits, along with the Fed's continued quantitative tightening (QT) aimed at stabilizing longer-term yields. Mortgage rates, closely tied to the 10-year yield, are nearing 7%, reflecting these pressures on broader financial conditions. The divergence between rising long-term yields and declining short-term yields points to expectations of future rate cuts, though longer-term yields recover towards pre-inversion levels due to stronger economic indicators and rising inflation. Despite previous forecasts in the real estate industry for lower mortgage rates, the normalization of 30-year fixed rates, rising from 6.11% to 6.90%, now mirrors historical norms, with higher home prices rather than rates presenting a more significant challenge for the housing market. The section titled \"The drivers\u2026\" explores how anticipated inflation and the expected inflation and the expected supply of new Treasury securities are key factors influencing long-term yields, with bond investors particularly concerned about financial losses from yields that may not keep pace with inflation. The article further elaborates in \"How much further can the 10-year yield go?\" on the potential stabilization or decline of the 10-year yield if inflation moderates and the labor market cools, although the current acceleration of core CPI inflation and a strong labor market could exert upward pressure on yields, likely raising mortgage rates above 7% and potentially dampening economic activity."

The article discusses the Treasury's strategy, which includes buying back 10-year Treasury notes, initially sold in August 2020 at a low yield of 0.677%, for 88 cents on the dollar due to their decreased value. The section by Wolf Richter outlines the initiation of a buyback program for Treasury securities in April, with the Treasury acquiring $7.0 billion in securities through October's auctions, although at significant discounts, highlighting the challenges from fluctuating yields. On October 23, the article specifies a buyback of $10 million in 30-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) from August 2020, and $40 million from August 2021, both with negative yields, reflecting past quantitative easing impacts. Further buybacks include $15 million and $40 million of 10-year TIPS repurchased with smaller discounts, indicative of quantitative tightening dynamics. On October 16, the Treasury reacquired various 7-year and 10-year notes, notably the 7-year notes from October 2020 and 10-year notes from February 2018 at 90.48% and 96.55% of par, showing a calculated buyback strategy. On October 10, the buyback included $17 million of new 7-year notes, $377 million of 10-year notes from April 2020, and $390 million of low yield August 2020 10-year notes, the latter at 82.71% of par. Meanwhile, on October 2, $22 million of 10-year TIPS from January 2018 and $10 million of 5-year TIPS from June 2023 were repurchased. The section \"Some buyback technicalities\" explores buyback mechanisms, clarifying they aren't novel but rather part of efforts to manage cash flow and liquidity, distinguishing these from Federal Reserve's Quantitative Easing as they entail using borrowed funds or tax revenue to replace old bonds with new ones by canceling repurchased securities."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article \"Inventory of New Spec Houses Spikes to Highest since 2009, Sales Grow as Builders Pile on Incentives and Trim Prices\" by Wolf Richter discusses the current dynamics of the housing market, highlighting that the inventory of new speculative homes has reached its highest level since 2009 due to builders increasing incentives and reducing prices to boost sales. Lennar, one of the major builders, has been at the forefront by offering significant discounts averaging $48,100 per house and reducing prices by 5.8% compared to the previous year. This strategy has enabled builders to capture market share from existing homes, where demand has decreased due to high prices. Consequently, new home sales have shown resilience despite challenging market conditions, with a 7.3% year-over-year increase in September sales of new single-family homes, matching the growth seen in September 2019. The segment \"Inventories balloon: a good thing, but not for builders\" details that the inventory of new completed houses has surged by 49% year-over-year, reaching its highest level since August 2009, with 110,000 homes. Speculative houses, which are ready for immediate occupancy, have driven this increase but have also caused financial pressure on builders due to the capital tied up in them, prompting swift sales through price reductions and incentives. Sales of completed new houses rose by 29% from the previous year, reaching 27,000 units, but the inventory of spec houses continues to grow, now standing at 4.1 months of supply at the current sales rate. The article also addresses \"Prices, mortgage-rate buydowns, and incentives,\" noting that while the median contract price for new single-family homes in September was $426,300, the six-month average declined to $418,000, marking the lowest point since May 2022. These prices benefit from mortgage rate buydowns and other incentives, significantly reducing buyers' monthly payments. Overall, the strategic use of incentives has allowed big homebuilders to maintain sales and capture market share amid the historically unusual conditions where new homes are priced competitively against existing ones, enabling them to navigate a market where many existing homeowners remain stagnant, anticipating rate drops."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article \"Demand Destruction for Existing Homes: Sales in 2024 to Plunge Below 4 Million Homes, Lowest since 1995, as Supply Spikes\" by Wolf Richter projects a significant decline in existing home sales for 2024, anticipating a drop below 4 million homes, a level not seen since 1995. This decline is attributed to high home prices leading to a buyers' strike, despite a brief period of lowered mortgage rates which have since increased, exacerbating the issue. The \"Demand Destruction for Existing Homes\" section outlines the diminishing demand despite rising inventory, lower mortgage rates, and seasonal adjustments, with the impact of higher mortgage rates worsening the situation. There's a surge in supply with 1.39 million homes in inventory, new listings rising as sellers attempt to capitalize on high prices, facing decreased demand and hesitant sellers. The \"Home Prices by Metro Vary Widely\" section discusses how home prices across metropolitan areas differ, with declines such as a 20% drop in Austin, while prices surge in cities like New York City. The \"Demand Destruction Has Occurred in All Regions\" section highlights demand destruction across all US regions, with the Northeastern US seeing sales nearly reach the lows of 2010, the Midwestern US hitting the lowest since the housing crash, the Southern US paralleling dips from the housing bust era, whereas the Western US saw a slight sales increase but still low since the 1990s. National Association of Realtors has shifted the blame away from high prices, attributing it to external factors like upcoming elections, though acknowledging the need for lower prices or significant wage growth to spur demand. Homebuilders have responded to these trends with lower prices and incentives, outperforming existing home sellers. Overall, these sections depict a widespread decline in home sales across the nation, with varying impacts in different metro areas and regions."

It underscores that liquidity in the financial system remains ample, as highlighted by Lorie Logan, the president of the Dallas Fed, who emphasizes that temporary fluctuations in money market spreads should not be concerning. Discussed in the Balance Sheet Composition section, Logan details potential adjustments to the Fed's balance sheet, including the possibility of selling mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and transitioning its holdings from longer-term Treasury securities to Treasury bills (T-bills) to streamline the portfolio, balance its maturity range, and maintain market stability. These actions aim to support the broader monetary policy objectives and prepare the Fed to be flexible, especially if interest rates are reduced to 0%. In the Liquidity section, Logan urges banks to make use of the Standing Repo Facility (SRF) and the discount window to ensure preparedness as liquidity reduces due to QT. She emphasizes these tools' significance in maintaining financial stability and managing fluctuations, particularly at quarter-end. Logan's remarks contributed to bond market volatility, reflecting the complexities of normalizing monetary policy tools and the Fed's evolving role as a liquidity provider."

In Section M, it is highlighted that real estate professionals are surprised by the impact on housing affordability and market dynamics, as the expected benefits of rate cuts have not occurred, creating challenges for potential homebuyers. Section B emphasizes that the 10-year yield reaching 4.20% is the highest since July 26, influenced by hawkish comments from Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, concerns about inflation, and increasing government debt. The situation presents challenges for bondholders amid Quantitative Tightening (QT), inflation, and rising debt supply, further complicating mortgage rates. In Section Y, the yield curve's changes are addressed, noting the 30-year yield's alignment with the 6-month yield\u2014ending an inversion from July 2022\u2014and the unmet expectations that rate cuts would reduce mortgage rates. This is due to short-term yields dropping while long-term yields rise from inflation fears and new debt supply, leaving only 3- to 5-year yields under 4%. Lastly, Section T explains the 1-year Treasury yield's rise to 4.25%, indicating changing market expectations about rate cuts, and the increase of the 2-year yield to 4.04% after de-inverting with the 10-year yield in early September. These movements underscore the complexities in forecasting interest rate paths amid economic uncertainties and policy shifts."

Cleanest Dirty Shirt?\" by Wolf Richter on Wolf Street outlines how foreign investors have bolstered their holdings of US Treasury securities amid the US's rising national debt, now at $35.8 trillion. Despite China's decreasing stake due to geopolitical tensions and a strategic shift to diversify its reserves, and Japan's struggles with a weakening yen, foreign interest in US debt has persisted, driven by relatively attractive US Treasury yields that eclipse those of many foreign sovereign debts. In the section \u201cWhich Foreign Countries Bought the Recklessly Ballooning US Debt: An Increasingly Crucial Question,\u201d the article reports foreign-held US debt reached a record high of $8.50 trillion in August, constituting 24.1% of the total US debt, up from 22.2% in October 2023. \"Many Piled it up\" notes that the Euro Area and other financial centers have significantly increased their holdings, contrasting the decline from China and stagnation from Japan, thereby altering the composition of US debt holders. The UK and other hubs have notably increased their positions, while smaller countries like Canada, Taiwan, and India have shown pronounced growth, underpinning their rising influence in the treasury market. The section \"Cleanest Dirty Shirt?\" remarks that Japan, despite maintaining substantial holdings, faces currency and policy challenges, highlighting little change over the past decade, amidst global economic uncertainties. This evolving dynamic underscores the US's dependency on foreign investment to manage its growing debt and reflects shifting global financial trends."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article \"Used Vehicles Getting Ready to Turn into Inflation Headwind, after Historic Plunge Had Powered Core CPI 'Deceleration'\" by Wolf Richter highlights the evolving challenges in the used vehicle market that are poised to impact inflationary trends. During the pandemic, heightened demand and supply constraints, particularly stemming from semiconductor shortages and cuts in new vehicle production, caused a surge in used vehicle prices by over 50% between mid-2020 and mid-2022, which was then followed by a sharp decline in 2022 as consumer behavior shifted, as discussed in \"Used-vehicle retail inventory fell further.\" Retail inventory levels drastically fell due to the lower availability of new vehicles (~6 million fewer sold from Q2 2021 to Q1 2023), impacting typical sources like rental fleets and lease returns. Consequently, \"Wholesale prices in the first half of October\" indicate a stabilization in the market, with the Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index showing marginal seasonal increases, suggesting the previous price drop is stabilizing, and year-over-year declines are shrinking. Similarly, in \"Used-vehicle retail listing prices,\" the average listing price at dealerships stabilized just above $25,000 in 2024, indicating a plateau informed by existing supply-demand dynamics. The section \"The first sign this is feeding into CPI\" reveals that in September, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for used vehicles experienced a month-to-month rise of 0.3%, halving the year-over-year decline to -5.1%. This stabilization ends the previous contribution of used vehicle price drops to slowing core CPI, with tight inventories and steady demand potentially leading to an upward pressure on core CPI, underscoring the broader economic implications."

This increase in consumer spending raises inflation concerns as it could further drive up prices. Contributing to this growth is a significant influx of immigrants from 2022-2024, adding to economic activity. The \"Retail sales in total and by category\" section reports a 0.6% rise in September retail sales and a 2.3% year-over-year growth, despite deflationary trends in some goods. Vehicle and parts stores showed a modest 0.7% increase, while ecommerce grew by 7%. Food services recovered with a 3.7% increase, and food and beverage stores saw a 2.3% rise. Gas station sales fell due to cheaper gasoline, while the building and clothing sectors experienced minor growths of 0.2% and 2.3%, respectively. Miscellaneous retailers, notably including cannabis stores, jumped by 7.1%, reflecting higher cannabis prices, and general merchandise stores had a 3.1% increase, all indicative of steady consumer demand. These economic changes suggest a trajectory that may defy the expected 'soft landing,' possibly maintaining higher growth and inflation."

The section \"Home-Purchase Demand Destruction Accelerates, Prices Too High, Buyers\u2019 Strike Deepens\" highlights how this resistance to purchase is set to drive the sales of existing homes to their lowest point since 1995, with the market dynamics heavily influenced by significant price points. According to \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET,\" since reaching nearly 8% by October 2023, mortgage rates have pressured demand, which stays subdued even after rates fell to about 6% in November 2023. The ongoing buyer's strike has persisted into 2024, as per \"The demand for existing homes in the market,\" with potential buyers sidelined by high housing costs despite increased inventory. Data from the Mortgage Bankers Association supports this low demand, reinforced by Fannie Mae's analysis predicting sustained affordability challenges suppressing home sales through 2024. In \"Mortgage rates experienced an uptick amid economic activity,\" the upward movement of mortgage rates to an average of 6.52% further complicates the picture for home sales, as even the previous interest rate drops hadn't improved sales significantly. This scenario is also marked by a decline in refinance mortgage applications, underlining the inverse relationship between mortgage rates and refinancing activity, thereby portraying a housing market wrestling with persistent affordability issues and consistently high prices."

This was partly due to the Bank of Canada's rate cuts, which spurred seller activity, resulting in new property listings increasing by 4.9% from August and 16.8% year-over-year. \"Home prices by market in Canada\" described specific regional trends, such as Greater Toronto Area single-family homes and condos falling 18.4% and 16.6% from their respective peaks, with Hamilton-Burlington seeing similar declines.

The tightening policies have led to a substantial reduction in exits, with public listings via IPOs and SPACs dropping dramatically by 91% in 2023 compared to 2021, causing a disrupted cycle of exits, fundraising, and dealmaking in the VC ecosystem. This blockage has resulted in many VC-backed companies staying private longer and struggling with funding, often necessitating new funding rounds at lower valuations, leading to a 26% growth in the backlog of private companies over three years. As a result, cash distributions to Limited Partners have plummeted to levels reminiscent of the global financial crisis, and a rise in \"zombie VCs\"\u2014firms existing mainly to collect management fees without making new investments\u2014has complicated the landscape further. Despite these challenges, certain sectors like AI still manage to attract investments, though overall, the scenario reflects a challenging environment for venture capitalists influenced by macroeconomic factors and regulatory changes. The article mentions a call for rate cuts to alleviate the situation, combined with a rise in longer-term Treasury yields, complicating investment dynamics and potentially causing long-term disruptions in exiting VC investments."

The Federal Reserve's decision to cut policy rates on September 18 was based on data suggesting a slowdown, yet subsequent revisions revealed stronger-than-expected economic growth, challenging those assumptions. In \"A bunch of massive up-revisions after the Fed meeting,\" upward revisions to consumer income and savings, improved economic indicators, and strong labor market data suggest a healthier economy than initially thought. Despite energy prices dropping, inflation is not subsiding as expected, with core CPI and producer prices rising, signaling increasing inflationary pressures (\"And so inflation is no longer going in the right direction\"). The Fed's policy rates remain above inflation, although there's debate about their restrictiveness and the real effective federal funds rate (\"The Fed\u2019s policy rates are still well above inflation rates\"). Sectors like AI are flourishing amid high interest rates, while commercial real estate struggles, indicating mixed signals across the economy (\"Yet the signals diverge\").

Over the past six months, core PPI rose by 3.4% and services PPI increased by 3.7%, suggesting persistent inflationary pressures, despite considerable declines in energy prices, which offer some relief. The section \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET\" notes that in September, the PPI saw only a minimal increase of 0.05% due to declining energy prices; however, excluding energy, the PPI saw significant inflation due to revised upward monthly changes. Core PPI rose by 1.9% annualized in September, with trends suggesting more accelerated inflation in 2024. In the section titled the \"Services PPI\" a 2.0% annualized increase is observed in September, with revisions from prior months leading to a six-month average acceleration to 3.7%. Additionally, the \"finished core goods\" PPI rose 2.6% annualized, remaining steady but suggesting inflation parameters from pre-pandemic times. Finally, \"For overall PPI,\" there was a moderate annualized increase of 0.6% in September, with past month revisions pushing the six-month average to 2.3%. While energy price drops mitigate general inflation, the service sector continues to exert inflationary pressure, and future inflation will depend on energy prices and other segment pressures."

        "summary": "The article from Wolf Street provides an analysis of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), highlighting that core CPI, excluding volatile food and energy prices, has accelerated for the third consecutive month due to a rise in used vehicle prices and persistent service inflation, despite a drop in gasoline prices. Under the Homeowner Insurance Rates section, the Owners' Equivalent Rent (OER), a significant component of CPI that tracks the imputed rent homeowners would pay if renting, increased at a faster rate than actual rents, reflecting rising costs for homeowners. In another section discussing Year-over-Year realizations, core CPI's year-over-year increase is 3.3%, driven by services, whereas the Overall CPI decelerated to 2.4% due to a drop in gasoline prices. The Core Services CPI section elaborates on the mixed results, with short-term metrics indicating a 4.4% rise in inflation, contrasting with a 6-month deceleration, driven by lower June readings, indicating varying inflationary pressures across time frames. Housing Components of Core Services discusses how housing expenses, particularly property insurance and taxes, influence OER, contributing to CPI. This section also notes substantial inflation in motor-vehicle insurance and service costs. In the Food Inflation section, the \"food at home\" CPI increased by 26% since January 2020, with significant year-over-year hikes, notably in egg prices, indicating ongoing inflation challenges in grocery sectors. The Apparel and Footwear section reports a shift from pre-pandemic deflation trends, with a 1.8% month-over-month rise in their prices. Meanwhile, in the Energy sector, the overall CPI fell by 1.9% month-over-month due mainly to a 4.1% drop in gasoline prices, countering inflation in electricity and natural gas, with some commodities like heating oil experiencing declines. Collectively, these elements contribute to a complex inflationary environment, with core components driving persistent pressure despite some offsetting declines."

        "summary": "The article \"Bond Market Smells a Rat: On Eve of CPI Inflation Data, 10-Year Treasury Yield Jumps to 4.08%, +43 bps since Monster Rate Cut\" by Wolf Richter on WOLF STREET discusses the bond market's sharp reaction as the 10-year Treasury yield surged to 4.08%, with a 43 basis point increase ahead of crucial CPI inflation data. This movement hints at investors losing faith in the Federal Reserve's ability to combat inflation effectively. In the section by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET, the U.S. Treasury's sale of $39 billion in 10-year notes at a yield of 4.066% attracted strong demand, especially from foreign investors. The uptick in yields for longer maturities, symptomatic of inflation concerns and increased debt issuance due to a rising deficit, counterbalances expectations of rate cuts for shorter-term yields, resulting in a gradual un-inversion of the yield curve. Although the 10-year and 30-year yields remain just shy of pre-rate cut expectation levels, mortgage rates have jumped, with the 30-year fixed rate now at 6.61%. The bond market remains wary of inflation risks indicated by rising wages, revised job creation figures, accelerated CPI inflation, and a potential boom in debt supply, which fuels the uncertainty and volatility in the market."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article \"Florida Housing Market Buckles\" details the challenges facing the Florida housing market, with listing prices dropping to a 30-month low yet remaining high. The market is saturated with a significant increase in inventory as properties linger longer without offers. Anthony Holmes's experience exemplifies these difficulties as his Tampa home, bought for $550,000 in 2021 and improved with $50,000, remains unsold at a reduced price of $583,900 after eight months on the market, highlighting the issue of prices being too high. \"We know why he \u201ccan\u2019t unload the thing\u201d\" points out that homes aren't selling due to unrealistic listing prices despite increased Florida home purchases over the years. The median listing price has fallen by 11% since June 2022, with single-family home sales seeing only a slight gain and condo prices declining. In \"Price reductions to deal with a too-high listing price,\" the article notes Florida's 76% increase in price reductions, indicating adjustments were needed to draw in buyers. Many are disregarding seller investments, and sales need realistic pricing. \"Big institutional investors have turned into net sellers\" examines how large investors, having seen substantial gains, are capitalizing by selling properties they bought during the mortgage crisis, adding to listings in places like Tampa, Orlando, and Jacksonville. This intensifies competition for sellers like Holmes. He's also competing against those who purchased properties in the Housing Bust and can still profit even with lower sale prices. Therefore, \"That\u2019s the competition Mr. Holmes has to deal with\" underlines his struggle with mounting costs as his vacant home remains unsold amid a downward market. With \"Active listings pile up,\" Florida records a 35% surge in active listings compared to the previous year, the highest for any September since data collection started in 2016, signaling weakened demand due to high prices. In \"Median Days on the Market drag out,\" properties are taking longer to sell, with median days reaching 74, the highest since September 2019, hinting at desperation among some sellers. Lastly, \"So we wish Mr. Holmes best of luck\" suggests Holmes, having bought during a housing bubble, should act fast and reduce prices to curb his losses, illustrating the risk in real estate investments during market downturns."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article \"People Are Now on Buyers\u2019 Strike Because Home Prices Are too High: Fannie Mae\" highlights the current challenges in the housing market. It discusses how Fannie Mae's Home Purchase Sentiment Index (HPSI) initially rose to a 30-month high of 73.9 in September due to consumer optimism about declining mortgage rates. However, after a Federal Reserve rate cut, mortgage rates unexpectedly surged, leading to renewed inflation concerns. This shift has intensified difficulties for potential homebuyers already facing high property prices, sparking what is termed a \"buyer\u2019s strike,\" where many are refusing to purchase due to unsustainable costs, slowing the market. In the \"by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET\" section, it's noted that the HPSI increase reflects cautious optimism for lower mortgage rates, although it's still significantly below the 2019 level of 91.5. In the \"Great time to sell, terrible time to buy: that doesn\u2019t work\" section, it's noted that 65% of consumers believe it's a good time to sell, resulting in increased home inventory as sellers list properties amid lower mortgage rates, yet 81% perceive it as a bad time to buy, collapsing demand for existing homes. The \"Buyers\u2019 strike because prices are too high: Fannie Mae\" section elaborates further on how high prices, despite shifting sentiments towards more favorable mortgage rates, prevent buyers from entering the market, with existing home sales predicted to slump to their lowest since 1995. Even with brief optimism from initially lowered rates, current increases have reignited hesitance. Many consumers expect continued price hikes, negating any affordability gains from reduced rates, although areas like Austin show declining prices when buyers withdraw. Fannie Mae forecasts a persistent buyers' strike despite rate cuts and more listings, with consumers still hoping for lower rates, prices, and improved wages that haven't materialized, stressing the need for price adjustments to enhance housing affordability."

The section \"More Evidence this May Be the End of the Historic Plunge of Used Vehicle Prices that Had Pushed Down CPI\" suggests that tight supply and strong demand may stabilize the market. Although wholesale prices decreased slightly in September, the decline was less pronounced than usual, and prices have already shed nearly half of their pandemic-related increase, indicating stabilization. \"Used-vehicle retail inventories remain tight\" highlights a drop in retail inventory due to diminished new vehicle production caused by semiconductor shortages, although used vehicle retail sales improved by 9% year-over-year in September. \"Prices of used EVs and ICE vehicles\" explores the price dynamics where used electric vehicle (EV) prices rose significantly between January 2020 and July 2022 but have since declined by 53% of their spike, while internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle prices followed a similar pattern with a 46% reduction of the spike. EV prices are still notably higher than ICE prices compared to pre-pandemic levels. Lastly, \"Wholesale prices in some of the most popular segments\" reviews trends in segments where SUV and compact car prices gained slightly in September but are down year-over-year, while pickup trucks and midsize cars faced declines, all of which have seen substantial reductions from their pandemic peaks."

        "summary": "The article by Wolf Richter on Wolf Street discusses the significant increase in mortgage rates, which have reached their highest levels since the early 2000s, alongside the spike in yields for 2-year and 10-year Treasury securities due to market adjustments. This spike has dampened expectations for large-scale interest rate cuts while inflation fears have resurfaced, complicating changes in the bond market. In the section \"Yields jumped the most in the middle on crushed rate-cut expectations,\" it is highlighted that medium-term securities saw increases, with the 2-year yield rising significantly and reflecting a shift away from aggressive rate-cut hopes. The 10-year yield also increased, signaling inflation concerns and US debt supply issues. The section \"Despite the drama on the long end, not much happened at the short end\" explains that short-term yields, influenced by anticipated rate cuts, showed minimal changes with the 3-month yield seeing a slight increase but fluctuating within a narrow range. Meanwhile, the yield curve un-inversion due to fluctuating short-term yields and surging long-term yields didn't lead to the expected cheaper mortgage rates. Historically, after treasury yields decreased significantly in anticipation of rate cuts from July to September, the scenario shifted from September to October with short-term yields decreasing further while long-term yields began to increase, indicating a change in market outlook amid inflation fears. The article concludes with the observation that the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate significantly rose as the Fed's decreased market support and absence of Quantitative Easing reshape market dynamics."

In the \"OK, Forget it, False Alarm, Labor Market Is Fine\" section, revisions revealed robust wage increases, reflecting stable growth akin to pre-pandemic levels. The section \"Bad Stuff Last Month Was Revised Away\" highlights that revisions in job data for September showed a gain of 254,000 jobs and stable growth, reducing the urgency for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates rapidly. The section \"Wages Jumped\" explains how wage growth accelerated, with significant increases in average hourly earnings, suggesting potential inflationary pressures and posing complex monetary policy decisions for the Fed. The \"No More Rate Cuts Needed?\" section reports that unemployment dipped to 4.1% amid a steady labor supply increased by immigration, indicating a healthy labor market dynamic. Finally, \"And the bond market woke up\" mentions that the bond market reacted to the news by seeing the 10-year Treasury yield increase by 12 basis points to 3.97%, marking the highest level since early August, as rising wages fuel overall inflation seen in the Consumer Price Index data."

        "summary": "The article by Wolf Richter on Wolf Street explores the Federal Reserve's quantitative tightening (QT) efforts. In September, the Fed's balance sheet decreased by $66 billion, now standing at $7.05 trillion, a level first reached in May 2020 following massive quantitative easing (QE) during the pandemic. Since April 2022, the Fed has reduced its balance sheet by $1.92 trillion, shedding 40% of the pandemic's QE assets. The \"QT Assets by Category\" section highlights that the Fed reduced Treasury securities by $24 billion, totaling a $1.41 trillion reduction since June 2022. Holdings of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) decreased by $18 billion, totaling a $458 billion reduction from its peak. In \"Bank Liquidity Facilities,\" the Discount Window balance remains at $1.6 billion, while the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) borrowed amounts decreased by $27 billion to $71 billion in September. The Fed plans to phase out BTFP by March 2025. The section \"Balance Sheet below $7.0 Trillion\u2026\" predicts the balance will fall below $7 trillion as $48 billion in assets roll off soon, driven by a $42 billion monthly reduction in Treasury and MBS, while the BTFP's decline could influence the total. If trends remain steady, the balance sheet should dip below $7 trillion by late October or November 2023, a detail marking its decline from the April 2022 peak of $8.97 trillion."

        "summary": "In the article \"Here Come the Vacant Homes,\" author Wolf Richter discusses the unexpected surge in new home listings during September, a month typically characterized by a decrease in listings. The significant increase in listings, particularly in areas like San Diego and Southern Silicon Valley, indicates that many sellers are releasing their vacant homes into the market, responding to sluggish sales due to prices perceived as too high by potential buyers. Consequently, active listings have risen 34% year-over-year, with notable increases in cities like Tampa, Orlando, Seattle, and Miami, as sellers who previously held onto properties during price spikes now contribute to the increased housing inventory. The \"But buyers are still on strike because prices are too high\" section highlights that existing home demand has decreased as prices remain high, leading buyers to prefer new houses that often come with lower prices and incentives from homebuilders. Despite a brief decline, mortgage rates have risen again following the Fed's September rate cut, keeping mortgage applications at historic lows. The median listing price for homes has declined for several consecutive months, going below levels seen two years ago, with 23 of the top 50 metro areas, including Miami, witnessing notable price drops. Homes are also taking longer to sell, with the median days on the market reaching 55 days in September, the highest since 2019. Despite significant price reductions, demand remains weak, indicating challenges in attracting buyers in the current market environment."

In the section by Wolf Richter, it is highlighted that US new vehicle sales fell by 5% year-over-year to 3.88 million units, due to sustained high vehicle prices initially caused by shortages. Stellantis experienced a notable 20% decline in sales, illustrating elevated pricing strategies' impact. Despite increased incentives by 63% year-over-year to $3,047 per vehicle, automakers are still focused on high profit margins, with average transaction prices decreasing by 3% year-over-year in September to $44,467. In the \"Sales at the biggest automakers in Q3\" section, General Motors saw a 2.2% sales decline despite a rise in EV sales and is expanding its lineup amidst supply chain challenges. Toyota\u2019s sales decreased by 8%, yet its first battery-electric model, the bZ4X, gained traction.

Hyundai-Kia\u2019s sales grew by 5.5%, and they plan to shift EV production to the US by 2025. Honda's sales increased by 8% with the Prologue EV. Stellantis faced significant sales declines due to excess inventory and dealer dissatisfaction. Nissan had a slight sales decrease but substantial EV sales growth, while Tesla's global sales growth continues, though their high-growth narrative is waning."

However, Tesla's growth is not meeting the previously anticipated high-growth rates, as total deliveries of 1.294 million vehicles in the first three quarters show a 2.3% decline compared to the same period in 2023. Tesla will need to deliver a record 515,000 vehicles in Q4 to exceed its 2023 figures. The high-growth narrative is struggling due to insufficient recovery in Q2 following a significant Q1 drop. Model 3 and Model Y deliveries also hit a record in Q3 with 439,975 units, but are still behind Q1 and Q4 of last year. The Model Y is now the second best-selling vehicle in the US, just behind the Toyota RAV4 and ahead of the Ford F-150, while overall EV sales achieved a 9% market share in Q2. However, Tesla's US EV market share is dropping toward 50% amidst rising competition. Cybertruck production is gradually ramping up, contributing to 22,915 \"Other Models\" delivered in Q3, with expectations to reach 250,000 units by 2025, although current production is at 1,000 per week. In China, Tesla faces a price war and fierce competition, particularly from BYD, leading to sales incentives and discounts. In California, Tesla's biggest market in the US, sales declined for four quarters amidst rising sales of other EVs; while the Model Y remains the best-seller, its sales dropped 15% year-over-year in Q2, posing challenges for Tesla as further Q3 data emerges."

It highlights how cities such as San Francisco, Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, Seattle, and Washington DC have recorded all-time high office space availability, contrasting sharply with the pre-pandemic \"war for space\" period when office spaces were in high demand. The section \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET\" reports that in Q3 the availability rates for office leases were highest in San Francisco at 36.6%, followed by Atlanta, Dallas-Ft. Worth, Chicago, and Houston, countering landlord claims that the glut had plateaued. Limited new supply and high demand in 2019 have been overturned by pandemic-induced corporate tenant rethinking, particularly with leasing activities focusing on renewals, relocations, and downsizing. This focus, coupled with a \"flight to quality\" where tenants prefer top-tier offices, has left older buildings with high vacancy rates, reduced value, and increased financial struggles. The final section notes that San Francisco, once thriving, now sees a 36.7% availability rate and a 24% drop in Class A rents since 2019, while other markets have faced rent increases as landlords struggle to meet loan obligations."

Employers are regaining control as fewer workers are quitting, likely due to fears of layoffs, leading to fewer job openings and reduced hiring activity. Despite these concerns, actual layoffs remain historically low. The voluntary quits have dropped to their lowest since early 2018, resulting in reduced job churn and a stabilized labor market. However, new job creation has slowed considerably. Job openings, although still high, have decreased from pandemic levels, making the ratio of job openings to unemployed people remain over 1, indicating more jobs than job seekers, but this ratio is lower than in the pre-pandemic labor market. Employers are holding on to their workers, as evidenced by layoffs and discharges being historically low. The drop in hiring is linked to a stable labor market but raises concerns about the slowdown in new job creation, with the ratio of hires to nonfarm payrolls being lower than the tight labor markets of 2017-2019."

Jonathan Gray of Blackstone and other CRE fund managers suggest the market may have hit bottom, but significant challenges remain. The office CMBS delinquency rate surged to 8.4%, the highest since the Great Recession, driven by an oversupply of office space that companies no longer need. The retail CMBS delinquency rate rose to 7.1%, with the ongoing shift to ecommerce leading to abandoned malls and bankrupt retail chains. Lodging CMBS saw a delinquency rate increase to 6.2%, impacted by tourists' preference for vacation rentals over hotels, exacerbating hotel vacancy rates in tourist-heavy cities. Multifamily CMBS remained steady at a 3.3% delinquency rate, significantly lower than its peak during the Great Recession, with US government guarantees covering over half the market. The industrial CMBS sector, however, remains robust with a historically low delinquency rate of 0.3%, driven by ecommerce demand despite some oversupply during the pandemic. The article underscores the varying health of different CRE sectors, noting that structural problems in office, retail, and lodging are unlikely to be mitigated by changes in monetary policy."

Central Banks Diversify to 'Nontraditional' Currencies and Gold,\" it is reported that central banks worldwide are increasingly diversifying their reserves away from the US dollar, with its share dropping to the lowest level since 1995. Despite this trend, China's renminbi has not gained ground and continues to lag as a global reserve currency, even falling behind the Australian dollar. The article notes that as of Q2 2024, the US dollar's share of global foreign exchange reserves stands at 58.2%, down from 66% in 2015, with a potential decline to 50% over the next decade. Historically, the USD's share of global reserves fluctuated significantly, hitting a low of 46% in 1991 due to high inflation in the US. Central banks globally held $12.35 trillion in reserves by Q2 2024, with $6.68 trillion denominated in USD. The euro remains the second-largest reserve currency, holding around 20% of global reserves. The emergence of \"nontraditional reserve currencies\" has seen their share rise from 2.5% in 2019 to 4.2% in Q2 2024. The IMF identifies 46 \"active diversifiers\" holding at least 5% of their reserves in these currencies. Gold has also re-emerged as a favoured reserve asset, with central banks increasing their holdings to around 1.16 billion troy ounces, valued at $3.1 trillion. Additionally, the article notes that foreign exchange reserves are reported in USD, leading to variations in value based on exchange rates. Despite these fluctuations, the US Dollar Index (DXY) has remained relatively stable."

        "summary": "The recent article \"Consumer Income & Savings Rate Revised Massively Higher for 2 Years, Spending Revised Up Too. Stunning Numbers\" by Wolf Richter reveals that data revisions from the Bureau of Economic Analysis indicate consumers have experienced higher incomes, greater savings rates, and increased spending over the past two years than previously estimated, suggesting a more robust post-pandemic economic recovery. The section \"Personal income_without_transfer receipts, adjusted for inflation,\" shows that personal income without government transfers grew at a year-over-year rate of 3.1% in August and 3.2% in July, substantially higher than the 1.6% previously estimated for July. The revised two-year increase is now 6.0%, compared to the older estimate of 3.6%. In the section \"Disposable income, adjusted for inflation,\" the revised disposable income data reveals year-over-year increases of 3.1% for August and 3.2% for July, contrasting sharply with the 1.1% old estimate for July. Over two years, this metric shows an 8.5% increase, higher than the initial 5.5%, with five revised months recording growth over 3.1%. The section \"Consumer spending adjusted for inflation\" indicates slightly higher consumer spending, with revised year-over-year gains of 2.9% for August and 2.8% for July, marginally up from the 2.7% old estimate, and a 5.6% rise over two years versus the 5.3% previously reported. The section \"And the savings rate, oh-la-la\" reports a significant upward revision in the savings rate to 4.8% in August and 4.9% in July, far above the initial 2.9%, altering the perception of consumers being reckless spenders. Lastly, the \"GDP too\" section details that revised GDP figures show the pandemic economic growth was stronger than previously thought, with Q2 2024 GDP being $305 billion higher than earlier estimates and a 5.8% real GDP growth since late 2021, compared to the former 4.9%."

        "summary": "In the article \"Fed Favored Annual Core PCE Price Index Accelerates to 2.7%, Highest since April, on Higher Core Services Inflation (+3.8%). Durable Goods -2.2%, Energy -10%,\" Wolf Richter details the recent trends in the Fed's favored inflation measure, the Core PCE price index, which increased by 2.7% year-over-year in August, marking its highest rise since April due to rising core services inflation of 3.8%. Despite decreases in durable goods prices (-2.2%) and energy prices (-10%), inflation remains high, particularly in the housing sector, frustrating Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The overall PCE price index, including food and energy, rose 2.2% year-over-year in August, moderated by significant declines in energy prices and slower food price increases. The month-to-month moves section highlights a 1.6% annualized increase in the core PCE price index from July, indicating a deceleration with core services prices rising and durable goods falling. The six-month annualized core PCE index decelerated to 2.4%, with core services contributing factors like housing and healthcare rising by 2.8% annualized in August and a six-month trend of 3.3%. Housing costs surged 5.7% annualized, maintaining high inflation rates. In contrast, durable goods prices fell 2.9% annualized due to decreased pandemic-driven demand and better supply chains."

        "summary": "In the article \"Corporate Pricing Power and Therefore Inflation Not Vanquished, Says Renewed Spike in Corporate Profits in Most Industries\" by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street, it is reported that corporate profits surged in Q2 across most industries, indicating ongoing robust pricing power and maintaining inflationary pressures despite measures to curb it. In the section \"Corporate profits have surged in Q2 across most industries,\" the article notes that underlying dynamics challenge the notion that inflation has been subdued. During 2021 and 2022\u2019s inflation shock, corporate profits soared due to increased pricing power, which allowed companies to hike prices, thus propagating inflation. According to the section \"By Wolf Richter for Wolf Street,\" corporate pre-tax profits in non-financial industries grew by 4.1% from Q1 and 12.5% year-over-year in Q2, driven by businesses adjusting prices quicker than their costs. Profits notably jumped in sectors like construction, healthcare, and tech, indicating increased consumer and business willingness to absorb these costs, while worker demands for higher wages further contributed to price adjustments. Despite efforts by the Federal Reserve to curb inflation by raising the cost of capital, falling long-term interest rates have complicated this fight. The section \"Profits across various industries, such as financials, information, retail, and manufacturing, showed notable increases,\" states that while wholesale trade and transportation marked a slight dip, the methodology behind these figures includes adjustments for inventory valuation, capital consumption, and exclusions of capital gains and dividends to accurately reflect profits from current production."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article titled \"Here Comes the Inventory of New Spec Houses, Highest since 2009. Sales Jump, Builders Take Share from Homeowners,\" written by Wolf Richter, reports a significant increase in the inventory of completed new single-family houses, reaching its highest level since 2009 with a 46% year-over-year increase and over 200% growth since mid-2021, culminating in 104,000 units in August. This surge is helping to address price dislocations in the broader housing market. Builders are gaining market share from individual homeowners as sales of new spec houses jump. The inventories of all houses under construction have grown to 470,000 units, reflecting a rising trend with a current supply duration of 8.2 months. Sales of completed houses saw a 53% year-over-year increase to 29,000 units, providing critical market supply. Sales of houses at various construction stages grew 11.5% year-over-year to about 58,000 in August, a 4% rise from August 2019, with homebuilders benefiting from the reluctance of existing homeowners to lower their price expectations. \"Prices of new houses have dropped to prices of resale houses\" notes that contract prices for new single-family houses fell 4.6% from the previous year and 8.8% from the October 2022 peak, excluding mortgage-rate buydowns averaged at $47,100 per house. Builders are constructing less expensive homes with fewer amenities and additional incentives, resulting in the median price of new houses aligning closely with resale house prices at $421,533 in August. Lastly, \"Homebuilders take an ever-larger share from homeowners\" highlights that new single-family houses accounted for over 17% of total single-family house sales in July and August, a rate not seen consistently since before the Financial Crisis. This indicates that big homebuilders are effectively navigating the current market by aggressively pricing new homes and offering incentives, which helps mitigate the pricing issues in the housing market."

In the section \"Who Holds This $35.3 Trillion in Treasury Debt?\" it is explained that $7.11 trillion is \"debt held internally\" by government pension funds and the Social Security Trust Fund, while $28.2 trillion is \"held by the public,\" with $27.05 trillion being marketable securities such as Treasury bills, notes, bonds, TIPS, and FRNs. In \"Who Holds the $27.05 Trillion in Marketable Treasury Securities?\" the article cites the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) Quarterly Fixed Income Report for Q2, revealing that 33.5% of these securities are held by foreign entities, with increasing holdings in Europe, Canada, India, and others, despite reductions by China and Brazil. \"The US Entities That Hold the Remaining 66.5%\" details that US mutual funds hold 17.7% or about $4.8 trillion, the Federal Reserve holds 16.1%, US individuals 11.1%, banks 8.1%, state and local governments 6.2%, pension funds 3.7%, and insurance companies 2.2%, with Berkshire Hathaway's recent investments influencing this rise. Other entities hold 1.4%. The article highlights that while these interest-bearing assets are investments for holders, they represent significant liabilities for the US government, impacting the allocation of tax receipts towards interest payments, a trend addressed further in a separate discussion on the national debt burden."

Despite the growth in other sectors, the unemployment rate has risen to 3.9%. Substantial job declines have been recorded in the Information, Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services, and Financial Activities sectors since mid-2022. These sectors, heavily impacted by the relocation of major financial institutions like Wells Fargo and Charles Schwab, haven't been compensated by the gains in healthcare and other industries. Information sector jobs are down by 20% from their peak in 2022, now at their lowest since January 2020, while Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services have seen an 8.1% decrease since June 2022. Financial Activities have continued their long-term decline with a 6.1% drop since August 2022. Overall private-sector nonfarm jobs fell by 0.3% in August from July, remaining 5.6% below February 2020 levels. The leisure and hospitality and retail sectors also suffered significantly during the pandemic, even as remote work boosted Information sector hiring. The unemployment rate in the metro area rose to 3.9% in July from 3.6% in June, which is higher than in previous years but still below the national rate of 4.2%."

        "summary": "Days after a rate cut, S&P's Flash PMI data indicates rising inflation and urges the Federal Reserve to \"move cautiously\" with additional rate cuts. The data highlights a \"reacceleration of inflation,\" suggesting that the Fed should not entirely divert its attention from its inflation target. This development underscores the complex balancing act facing the Federal Reserve between fostering economic growth and managing inflationary pressures. The latest S&P preliminary Flash US Composite PMI, collected from September 12 to 20, warns about the potential need for cautious Fed rate cuts due to reaccelerating selling-price inflation in both services and manufacturing sectors, and increasing input-cost inflation in services. The report suggests the Fed's FOMC might need to be cautious in implementing further rate cuts in light of these inflationary pressures. September's Composite PMI score of 54.4 indicates solid business activity growth, rounding off the strongest quarter since early 2022. Strong growth in the services sector, the majority of the economy, drove this while manufacturing sector output slightly declined. The summary section titled \"Continued divergence between services and manufacturing\" states that the S&P\u2019s Flash Services PMI for August was 55.4, indicating solid growth at the second-highest rate in 29 months. Services have maintained a similar pace of growth for the past five months and are a significant part of the economy. In contrast, manufacturing, which represents a smaller fraction of the economy and employment, has struggled post-pandemic. For September, the flash Manufacturing PMI dropped modestly to 47, a 15-month low, indicating contraction. The section \"Inflation dynamics entail a warning to the Fed about rate cuts\" elaborates that inflation dynamics are signaling caution to the Federal Reserve regarding potential rate cuts. Both goods and services are experiencing price increases at the fastest pace seen in six months, driven notably by rising wages in the services sector. This \"reacceleration of inflation\" indicates the Fed cannot completely disregard its inflation targets while aiming to maintain economic growth, prompting a careful approach to rate cuts despite a weakening hiring trend. Selling price inflation is rising in both services and manufacturing, reaching six-month highs and surpassing pre-pandemic averages, indicating persistently high rates of increase. Input cost inflation shows a divergence; while service sector costs hit a 12-month high due to wage growth, manufacturing input costs have cooled to a six-month low due to lower energy prices and reduced supply chain pressures. PMIs, or Purchasing Managers' Indices, illustrate these trends based on monthly surveys of company executives, where a value above 50 suggests growth, below 50 indicates decline, and the distance from 50 shows the magnitude of change. This data warns of the need for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to cautiously navigate further rate cuts in the current inflationary environment."

        "summary": "The article by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street examines the shifts in the yield curve before and after a recent Federal Reserve rate cut, focusing on why longer-term yields have risen post-cut. The section \"The Yield Curve Before & After the Rate Cut\" outlines that short-term Treasury yields have dropped due to Fed actions and expectations, while long-term yields and mortgage rates have seen an uptick, leading to a gradual un-inverting of the yield curve. In \"Why Have Longer-Term Yields Risen since the Rate Cut?\", it is explained that longer-term yields have increased due to several factors, including that numerous anticipated rate cuts are already priced into short-term yields. Additionally, inflation concerns have resurfaced as the Fed loosens monetary policy amidst a strong economy marked by high employment and robust consumer spending, prompting investors to adjust their pricing for longer-term securities. The section \"Already Priced in?\" elaborates on how short-term Treasury yields like the 3-month and 6-month have dropped in anticipation of near-term Fed rate cuts, while the 1-year and 2-year yields reflect expected rate cuts over a longer duration. Meanwhile, the 10-year yield has increased slightly, mirroring investors' long-term inflation expectations and Fed policy bets. Mortgage rates, tracking the 10-year yield, have also risen and experienced a wider spread during quantitative tightening, with this trend expected to continue. The article concludes by highlighting that mortgage rates closely follow the 10-year Treasury yield, and both have edged up since the Fed's rate cut, reflecting shifts in bond yields and future inflation uncertainties."

It notes a significant drop in the demand for existing homes, with sales falling to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.86 million, the lowest since the Housing Bust, despite a substantial decline in mortgage rates from 7.9% to 6.09% over the past ten months. This decline in demand is attributed to a buyers' strike, where potential homebuyers are holding off in hopes of securing lower prices, lower mortgage rates, and higher wages. Concurrently, supply has surged to its highest level for any August since 2018, with unsold inventory reaching its peak since October 2020 and supply now standing at 4.2 months. The rise in supply is driven in part by homeowners who, having kept their properties off the market during price spikes, are now listing them. Despite high median prices for single-family houses at $422,100 and condos at $366,500, there have been recent declines or slow growth, signaling market softening. Additionally, properties are staying on the market longer, with the median number of days rising to 53, the highest since 2019. The article also suggests that sellers are pulling unsold homes off the market and relisting them later, impacting the metrics used to track market aggressiveness and selling speed."

        "summary": "In a detailed analysis by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET, Fannie Mae reveals a pessimistic outlook on home sales, forecasting that the current buyers' strike will persist despite a significant drop in mortgage rates and an increase in listings. According to Fannie Mae's Economic & Strategic Research group, mortgage rates plummeted from 7.9% to 6.15%, but this reduction hasn't been enough to jumpstart the housing market. Buyers are holding out for even lower rates, better home prices, and higher wages, signaling that the current conditions are inadequate for a substantial rebound in home sales. The Economic & Strategic Research group further predicts that 2024 will witness the fewest existing home sales since 1995, even with the expected average rate for next year being 5.9%, a notable decrease from 7.9% in November 2023. This forecast is in sync with trends in the 10-year Treasury yield and expected Federal Reserve rate cuts. Existing home sales are anticipated to decline by 0.3% in 2024 compared to 2023, mirroring data from the National Association of Realtors which shows a 2.0% year-to-date drop. Despite the lower rates, mortgage applications have drastically fallen due to persistently high prices, with current application levels significantly lower than those in 2019 and 2021. Overall, demand remains suppressed as potential buyers wait for improved affordability, reduced rates, and higher incomes."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter discusses the resurgence in used-vehicle unit sales, driven by much lower prices that have attracted more buyers into the market. The article's \"Used-Vehicle Unit Sales Jump\" section highlights an 8% increase in retail sales of used vehicles in August from July, reaching 1.68 million units, and a 14% rise year-over-year, based on Cox Automotive data. Factors contributing to this surge include a ransomware attack in June disrupting CDK's dealer management system, pushing sales processing into early July. The combined retail sales for June, July, and August saw a 5.7% year-over-year increase to 4.52 million units, outpacing the 2.8% rise in the first five months of the year. Although retail prices have fallen due to increased supply, tight inventories, especially of 2- and 3-year-old off-lease vehicles and trade-ins, present challenges, leading to a 3.3% year-over-year decline in certified pre-owned (CPO) sales in August, but an 11% increase from July. Wholesale auction prices also rose for the second consecutive month in August, signaling a potential end to the price decline trend, with retail prices giving up 60% of the 2020-2021 spike. New vehicle sales rebounded in August, reversing June's decline caused by the CDK ransomware attack, with cumulative sales for June, July, and August up 0.5% to 4.01 million units.

        "summary": "In August, Canada's housing market experienced significant fluctuations as home prices fell by 3.9% year-over-year and plunged 16% from their peak values, with Toronto, Hamilton-Burlington, Victoria, and Ottawa seeing the largest declines. Despite the downturn, Montreal and Vancouver also reported dips in their home prices, while Calgary experienced its first price drop after an extended period of increases, and Edmonton and Quebec City reached new peak prices. According to Wolf Richter for Wolf Street, the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) reported a 15.8% drop from the peak in March 2022, with single-family home prices falling by 16.2% and condo prices by 10.4%. The Hamilton-Burlington metro experienced a 21% drop, Greater Toronto was down by 17.5%, while Calgary saw a slight decrease, and Quebec City and Edmonton hit new price highs. Under the \"Sales and Inventory in Canada\" section, it was noted that home sales increased by 1.3% from July but fell by 2.1% compared to August last year, remaining 9.0% down from the 10-year average for this time. Despite rate cuts and quantitative tightening by the Bank of Canada, new listings saw a 1.1% uptick, marking six consecutive months of increases, with total listings climbing 18.8% year-over-year. The \"Home Prices by Market in Canada\" section detailed price changes in various markets, highlighting month-to-month and year-over-year fluctuations: Greater Toronto Area, Hamilton-Burlington, Greater Vancouver, Victoria, Ottawa, Calgary, Montreal, Halifax-Dartmouth, Edmonton, Quebec City, and Winnipeg showcased differing trends, with some markets seeing gains and others experiencing declines."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter discusses the record $7.4 trillion Americans have accumulated in balances across money market funds (MMFs) and Certificates of Deposit (CDs), showcasing high household savings and a trend towards low-risk, interest-earning accounts. In the section Money Market Funds, it is highlighted that MMF balances surged to $3.94 trillion by the end of Q2, driven by the attractiveness of higher yields compared to low-yield bank accounts. The total MMFs doubled since 2018 to $6.55 trillion, reflecting a significant shift in personal finance management. In the Large CDs section, banks were forced to increase deposit interest rates in 2022 and 2023 to compete with MMFs and T-Bills, with large time deposits rising nearly $1 trillion over two years before seeing a reduction when rates ceased increasing in mid-2023. Meanwhile, in Small CDs, smaller CD balances remained flat as interest rates stopped rising. The T-Bills section explains that the rise in Treasury bill investments also attracted funds away from traditional savings accounts, thanks to their higher yields. Overall, the article underscores the dynamic landscape of personal finance where Americans adjust their strategies based on interest rate fluctuations, constantly seeking higher returns on their cash."

Declining energy prices provided some relief to the overall PPI figures, leading to a more moderate acceleration. In the section by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street, it was highlighted that the Core PPI rose 3.9% annualized in August, driven mainly by services and finished core goods, reflecting persistent inflation trends despite a brief negative reading in July. Year-over-year, core PPI saw a 2.4% increase, with the services PPI experiencing an annualized rise of 4.6%, up from a slower pace in July attributed to a base effect expected to diminish in the forthcoming months. The services PPI has been volatile, showing marked fluctuations over the past year. The \"finished core goods\" PPI also saw a significant annualized increase of 4.1% in August, the highest since early 2023, suggesting rising inflation within core goods, although the overall situation remains less severe compared to 2021 and 2022. The overall PPI for final demand rose 2.9% annualized in August, recovering from a negative reading in July due to falling energy prices. Year-over-year, the overall PPI showed a 1.7% increase, decelerating from previous months, indicating that energy prices might not continue to mitigate inflation pressures indefinitely."

In August, Core Services CPI, which includes housing, healthcare, and insurance, rose to an annualized rate of 5.0%, influencing overall CPI and Core CPI re-acceleration. In contrast, prices for durable goods continued to decline. On a month-to-month basis, September's overall CPI rose by 0.19%, with Core CPI up by 0.28%, driven mainly by a 0.41% rise in Core Services CPI, while durable goods experienced a 0.36% drop, and food prices remained unchanged. Year-over-year, Core Services CPI rose by 4.93% in August, and Core CPI increased by 3.20%, as durable goods CPI declined by 4.2%, the largest drop since 2003. The month-to-month Core CPI saw a 0.28% rise from July to August, marking the second consecutive acceleration to an annualized 3.4%, with durable goods CPI continuing its decline. Core Services CPI rebounded for the second month, with a 5.0% annualized increase. Housing components of Core Services CPI showed a slight deceleration in rent growth to 4.5% annualized in August, while the Owners' Equivalent of Rent CPI increased by 6.1% annualized. Durable goods CPI experienced a 4.3% annualized decrease, the largest since 2003. Notably, new vehicle prices saw a slight 0.6% annualized increase, while used vehicle prices fell sharply. Food inflation for at-home consumption stayed high but stable, with notable increases in beef and veal prices by 4.2% and egg prices by 28.1% year-over-year. Apparel and footwear CPI saw a modest 0.29% month-to-month increase, while energy CPI declined by 0.8% month-to-month and 4.0% year-over-year. Gasoline prices, affected by seasonal adjustments, dropped significantly from their June 2022 peak."

Despite the BoC implementing its third interest rate cut, it has reduced its balance sheet by 52% from its peak, specifically cutting holdings of Government of Canada (GoC) bonds by $10 billion to $223 billion, the lowest since September 2020. The BoC projects continuing QT through September 2025, with an additional $47 billion in GoC bonds expected to mature during this period. Repos saw increased demand, recently reaching $16 billion, and total assets are down by 52% from their peak, now at $279 billion. The transition plan includes shifting from GoC bonds to short-term instruments like Treasury bills, which have currently tapered off to zero but are expected to increase. The \"Indemnity\" of $19.8 billion represents potential unrealized losses in GoC bonds, which will decrease as the bonds mature. Other assets purchased during the pandemic have varying values, with Provincial Money Market and Bankers' Acceptances at $0, Provincial bonds reduced to $8.0 billion, and Canada Mortgage Bonds declining to $5.4 billion. GoC Real Return Bonds stand at $4.3 billion, while Corporate bonds remain negligible."

        "summary": "According to a Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter, wholesale prices for used vehicles surged for the second consecutive month in August, potentially marking the end of the substantial deflation in this market segment. Driven by strong sales growth and tight inventories, this rise could influence the core Consumer Price Index (CPI), given the significant role used vehicle prices play in its calculation. The Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index indicated that auction prices for used vehicles across the US rose 1.2% in August from July, seasonally adjusted, with an unadjusted jump of 2.2%, suggesting a potential end to the dramatic price drops. Dealers, seeking to restock, are now bidding higher at auctions due to reduced supply from rental fleets, finance companies, and government fleets, which is expected to continue. Used vehicle retail sales have increased significantly year-over-year, signaling that higher auction prices will eventually impact the used-vehicle CPI. The 55% surge in used-vehicle CPI from mid-2020 through early 2022 substantially contributed to core CPI inflation, but this was followed by a significant decline since mid-2022. While wholesale price increases precede retail price changes by a few months, indicating recent drops in the used-vehicle CPI helped reduce core CPI, rising wholesale prices suggest a potential reversal soon. Retail inventories of used vehicles have dropped to 2.17 million by July, down from over 2.8 million pre-pandemic levels, primarily due to fewer maturing new leases. Preliminary August reports indicate a further contraction in inventories, suggesting an end to retail price declines amid strong sales and tight supplies. Wholesale prices for electric vehicles (EVs) spiked by 5.1% from July, while internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle prices rose by 2.0%. Despite significant price drops, EV prices have remained higher than ICE vehicle prices since mid-2021. Since January 2020, EV wholesale prices are up 70%, compared to a 35% increase for ICE vehicles. However, EVs represent a small portion of total auction sales, so their impact on the price index is minimal. The overall auction price index has risen 35.5% since 2020, with EV prices up 70.2% and ICE-vehicle prices up 34.6%."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter discusses the recent behaviors of the Treasury yield curve and its implications for predicting recessions in its sections: \"The Yield Curve\u2019s Steep Inversion, now Partial Un-inversion, the Sag in the Middle, and its Predictions of Recessions.\" The yield curve's inversion and recent partial un-inversions have been closely monitored due to their historical correlation with economic recessions, though its track record over the past 25 years shows mixed results, with four recession predictions, two of which were false alarms. The latest jobs report indicating deteriorating job creation contributed to a drop in yields across various maturities, with the largest declines in 1-year and 2-year yields, suggesting market expectations of multiple Fed rate cuts despite the current policy rates. Significant yield drops since July, especially in short-term maturities, led to a partial un-inversion between the 2-year and 10-year yields, yet the yield curve remains heavily inverted, particularly between the 3-month and 10-year yields, which shows a steep negative spread. The partial un-inversion, where the 2-year yield fell faster than the 10-year yield, resulting in a positive spread of 6 basis points, mirrors brief historical precedents in 2019 and 1998, which did not lead to immediate recessions. However, the ongoing steep inversion at the short-end indicates the yield curve is far from \u201cnormal.\u201d Given the distortions in the Treasury market caused by Federal Reserve policies like quantitative easing (QE) and quantitative tightening (QT), the yield curve's utility as a recession predictor is questioned, particularly as it displayed anomalous behaviors during rate cuts and QE interventions in 2019 without leading to a recession. Hence, caution is advised in over-relying on yield curve movements to forecast economic downturns."

It highlights that a mere 4% drop could push the Nasdaq back to its November 2021 levels, emphasizing the market's current volatility. Companies like Amazon, Tesla, and Alphabet have seen their stock values revert to levels from three to four years ago, while Nvidia has declined by 24% from its peak. The combined market value loss for key tech stocks, referred to as the Mag-7, stands at $2.5 trillion from their peak valuations, severely affecting the broader stock market.

Reporting under the section \"Payrolls at employers increased by 142,000 jobs in August,\" Richter highlights a rebound in job growth with the highest gain since May and a revised increase from 89,000 in July, impacted by Hurricane Beryl. Despite the uptick, the three-month average job growth remains at 116,000, a level relatively weak but still better than the lowest points in 2018 and 2019. In \"The Fed\u2019s rates are high, inflation has dropped, and the labor market could use some juicing up,\" the article discusses how high policy rates by the Federal Reserve have effectively controlled inflation but have concurrently slowed job creation, posing a challenge for new immigrants entering the labor market and causing a slight uptick in unemployment. It notes that while layoffs are low, suggesting companies are not broadly cutting jobs, the labor market's inability to grow rapidly enough to accommodate new workers is problematic. Given that policy rates are significantly above inflation and with hourly earnings rising without sparking substantial inflation, there is room for the Federal Reserve to cut rates to stimulate job growth and support the labor market."

        "summary": "In the Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter, it is highlighted that the Federal Reserve's balance sheet reduction through Quantitative Tightening (QT) hit a significant milestone in August, with a $66 billion decrease bringing the total to $7.11 trillion, a level last seen in June 2020. The article notes that the Fed has managed to shed 38% of the assets accumulated during the pandemic-driven Quantitative Easing (QE) period, with a total reduction from the peak amounting to $1.85 trillion. According to the section \"QT by category,\" August saw a $25 billion reduction in Treasury securities and an $18 billion decrease in Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS), with the latter's reductions accelerating to $18 billion per month recently due to increased refinancing applications. The \"Bank liquidity facilities\" section discusses the current balances of the Discount Window and Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), noting that the Discount Window's balance has significantly reduced from a peak of $153 billion to $1.5 billion, and the BTFP balance is set to drop to zero by March 2025 due to the program's expiration. Lastly, the section \"What else caused total assets on the balance sheet to drop?\" explains that another $13.4 billion reduction was due to adjustments in \"other assets\" and \"unamortized premiums,\" reflecting the Federal Reserve's practices of destroying money from received payments and amortizing bond purchase premiums. Overall, the Fed's strategic QT efforts are successfully reducing the balance sheet without market disruptions, aiming to avoid issues similar to the September 2019 repo market crisis."

Listings Surge, Home Sellers Slowly Drop Prices\" on Wolf Street by Wolf Richter, it is highlighted that the housing market experienced a significant slowdown in August, as both buyers and sellers waited for lower mortgage rates. Despite these lower rates, buyers' strike persisted, causing listing prices to drop year-over-year in several cities like Miami (-11.7%), San Diego (-9.1%), Kansas City (-8.5%), San Francisco (-7.7%), and Austin (-7.6%). Realtor.com reported continued declines in listing prices, increased price reductions, a surge in active listings, and longer days on the market. Pending sales in July hit their lowest level since 2001, with August sales expected to be similarly weak. The median listing price fell for the second consecutive month, but many sellers still hold high price expectations, leading to market stagnation. Among the 50 largest metropolitan areas, Miami and San Diego had the steepest year-over-year declines in median listing prices. August saw a high number of price reductions, yet buyer interest remained low, indicating excessively high current prices. Active listings surged to 909,300, the highest since May 2020, driven by collapsed demand at prevailing prices. The highest increases in active listings occurred in Tampa and San Diego. Unsold properties' median days on the market rose to 53 days, the longest for any August since 2019, reflecting sellers' reluctance to lower prices and their readiness to pull properties off the market to avoid prolonged listing periods.

In the \"In July\" section, it is reported that non-seasonally adjusted job openings rose by 720,000 to 8.34 million, yet after seasonal adjustments, the figure drops to 7.67 million. This overall trend shows a decrease in job openings from peak labor shortages but still higher than pre-pandemic levels. \"What is normal?\" explores the job openings to nonfarm employment ratio, which dipped to 4.9%, still higher than pre-pandemic conditions. The article also highlights that the ratio of unemployed persons per job opening stands at 0.93, showing a more sufficient supply of labor due to over 6 million immigrants from 2022-2024. Despite this, layoffs and discharges, recorded at 1.76 million in July, remain historically low as employers retain workers, a behavior termed as \"hoarding\". Voluntary quits slightly increased to 3.28 million in July, but the three-month average dipped to 3.30 million, indicating stability in the job market as fewer people change jobs. Hires rose to 5.52 million in July, and the combination of fewer voluntary quits, low layoffs, and slower job creation results in less hiring, marking a potential new normal for hiring rates."

Nvidia experienced a notable stock drop of 11.7% following news of a DOJ subpoena related to an antitrust investigation, leading to a $342 billion decrease in market capitalization, the largest single-day loss for any company. This decline contributed to Nvidia's market cap plunging to approximately half of Tesla's market cap. Prominent companies in the semiconductor sector, such as Intel, AMD, and Broadcom, also saw considerable stock declines, ranging from 5.8% to 9.5%. Consequently, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF and the PHLX Semiconductor Index experienced their steepest one-day drops since the market crash of March 2020. The broader market was affected, with the Nasdaq Composite falling by 3.3% and approaching November 2021 levels if it drops another 6.7%, and the S&P 500 down by 2.1%. Despite the substantial declines, there was no specific economic news triggering the drop; rather, it was part of a broader market trend where investors' heavy stock exposure and optimistic expectations about continuous price rises create market vulnerability during selling pressures. The article by Wolf Richter suggests that this exuberance is reminiscent of the Dotcom Bust era, although current investors seem to dismiss the likelihood of a similar downturn."

        "file_location": "./data/Construction Spending Squeaks to Record amid Eyepopping Boom in Spending on Factories while Residential Construction Tries to Dig Out of Last Year\u2019s Slump.md",
        "summary": "In a recent Wolf Street article, Wolf Richter reports that the majority of construction spending has been directed towards nonresidential projects, significantly focusing on factory construction. This boom has resulted in total construction spending reaching a record $199 billion in July, marking a 7.5% increase from the previous year. Both residential and nonresidential sectors contributed to this rise, with the seasonally adjusted annual rate peaking at $2.16 trillion, representing a 6.7% year-over-year increase. Historically, construction spending saw a 35% decline from 2007 to 2011, primarily due to the Housing Bust. Nonresidential construction spending, which constitutes 56% of the total, hit a record $109 billion in July, increasing by 6.1% from last year. This sector's annual rate, though slightly dipping, remained strong at $1.21 trillion, largely driven by a two-year 45% spike in investments in manufacturing plants and inflation. Spending on manufacturing plants alone set a new benchmark at $237 billion annually, spurred by high-value sectors like semiconductor and EV plants. Factory construction now accounts for a record 19.6% of nonresidential spending, doubling over the past four years. In the segment analysis, manufacturing saw significant growth, while commercial construction fell by 13.3%, and other sectors like power and water supply experienced double-digit increases. The inflation impact on nonresidential construction spending has largely moderated since early 2023. The section **\"Digging out of the slump: residential construction\"** reveals that residential construction has rebounded from its mid-2022 slump, reaching a record $90 billion in July, a 9.1% year-over-year increase. The seasonally adjusted annual rate fell to $952 billion, driven mainly by a surge in multifamily construction, which hit multi-decade highs in 2021, 2022, and 2023. Despite these gains, residential spending still lags behind the robust growth in the nonresidential sector."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article, \"Why We\u2019ll Replace the Case-Shiller Home Price Index for Our Series, 'The Most Splendid Housing Bubbles in America,'\" discusses the transition from the Case-Shiller Home Price Index to a more suitable metric for tracking housing market dynamics. Since 2017, the series \"The Most Splendid Housing Bubbles in America\" has monitored home price inflation influenced by the Federal Reserve's interest rate policies. The series highlighted home price surges due to near-zero interest rates from 2020 to mid-2022, driven by cheap mortgages. Wolf Street identified three main limitations of the Case-Shiller data: its coverage of only 20 metros, a 3-4 month data publication lag, and its use of index values instead of actual dollar prices, making it less suitable for current market analysis. The Case-Shiller index, published by S&P Global, was historically valuable but has not expanded or improved in timeliness. The article introduces the \u201craw\u201d Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) as a replacement. ZHVI draws from millions of data points, including historical prices, MLS, brokerages, and households, and accounts for both off-market and for-sale-by-owner deals. Unlike Zillow's forward-looking estimates, ZHVI is a backward-looking index responsive to market changes, albeit more volatile. It is analyzed by Census Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and focuses on \"typical homes,\" including single-family houses and condos. An example from the Austin MSA shows a 0.4% decline in \"typical home value\" to $460,000 in July, reflecting a 4.6% year-over-year decrease and an 18.9% drop from the June 2022 peak. The Case-Shiller index, which does not cover Austin, lacks price visibility and its data will be available later.\n"

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter titled \"Our Drunken Sailors Are at it Again, Not at All in the Mood for a Slowdown or a Recession\" discusses how consumer spending, adjusted for inflation, has increased by 0.39% in July from June, signifying robust economic activity with the highest three-month average growth since February 2023. The annualized growth rate for the past three months was 4.8%, while year-over-year growth was 2.7%. Spending on durable goods surged by 1.7% in July, achieving an annualized growth rate of 16.8%, and spending on non-durable goods grew by 0.24%, maintaining a robust annualized growth rate of 4.4%. Despite earlier predictions, durable goods spending has surpassed pre-pandemic trends. Spending on services, which make up 65.5% of total consumer spending, rose by 0.20% in July and 2.9% year-over-year, though it has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels. Consequently, these spending behaviors have bolstered the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow forecast for Q3 GDP growth to 2.5%. In the section \"Where did our Drunken Sailors get this money?\", the article highlights that personal income excluding transfer receipts, adjusted for inflation, rose by 0.16% in July from June, with a three-month average increase of 0.22% and a year-over-year growth of 1.7%. This reflects growth in employment, wages, and dividend and interest incomes. Disposable income, adjusted for inflation, grew by 0.11% in July from June and by 1.1% year-over-year, maintaining positive growth for 19 consecutive months. Despite this income growth, the savings rate dipped to 2.9%, as Americans spent less than they earned but still managed to save at a slower pace, driven by confidence from rising home and asset prices."

        "summary": "In August, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index slightly increased to 2.6%. Core services inflation rose to 3.7%, while durable goods experienced deflation of -2.5%. The overall PCE, including food and energy, went up by 2.50% in July, with energy and food prices increasing modestly. The core PCE, the Federal Reserve's key measure for its 2% inflation goal, saw a year-over-year rise to 2.62% in July from 2.58% in June. \"The month-to-month moves\" section highlighted the core PCE price index advancing by 2.0% annualized in July, matching June's figure, aligned with the Fed's target. Core services PCE price index accelerated to 3.1% annualized in July, up from June's 2.25%, with the six-month index at its lowest since February 2021, at 3.26%. Housing costs in core services rose by 4.78% annualized in July, reversing the prior month's drop, with a six-month annualized housing index at 4.8%. The durable goods PCE price index decreased by 3.7% annualized in July, covering items like motor vehicles and electronics, and the six-month index fell by 2.1%. Durable goods typically run slightly negative due to efficiencies, while services remain the primary inflation driver. This dynamic of durable goods deflation and high services inflation has been consistent throughout the year, with the six-month annualized core PCE decelerating to 3.3%."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article \"Spiking Interest Payments on the Ballooning US Government Debt v. Tax Receipts, GDP, and Inflation: Q2 Update\" by Wolf Richter discusses the growing concern of interest payments on the US national debt, emphasizing the increasing burden on tax receipts. The piece explains that an ever-growing portion of tax revenue is being directed towards debt servicing, limiting the government's financial flexibility and potentially leading to higher taxes or reduced services. In Q2, federal tax receipts rose by $69 billion, a 10.2% increase year-over-year, whereas interest payments surged by $45 billion, a 20% jump, hitting $272 billion. This trend can be linked to factors like inflation, employment growth, and wage increases, which reversed the decline seen in 2022 due to poor investment returns. The \"Interest payments as % of tax receipts\" section highlights that this ratio hit 36.3%, the highest since 1997, previously reaching crisis levels between 1982 and 1997. The section \"Interest payments have surged for three reasons\" attributes the surge to increased total debt at $35.3 trillion, replacement of older, lower-rate Treasury securities with higher-rate ones, and a rise in short-term Treasury bills from $4 trillion to $6 trillion. These factors combined have raised the average interest rate to 3.33%. In the \"Other measures of the burden of the debt\" segment, the article notes that interest payments as a percentage of GDP slightly dipped to 3.8% in Q2, the second highest since 1998. The debt-to-GDP ratio decreased to 121.6%, however, this reversed in Q2 2023 as the GDP grew slower than the national debt. Historically, the ratio surged from 63% to 100% between 2008 and 2012 due to economic crisis measures, and currently stands at 121.6%, highlighting ongoing debt accumulation. This comprehensive analysis underscores the long-term fiscal challenges facing the US."

The National Association of Realtors (NAR) indicated that a mid-summer sales recovery did not occur due to high home prices and affordability challenges, exacerbated by uncertainty around the upcoming U.S. presidential election. Pending home sales, a leading indicator of closed sales, fell by 5.5% in July from June and 8.5% year-over-year, reaching the lowest index value since 2001 at 70.2. Despite mortgage rates dropping to 6.35%, already pricing in anticipated Fed rate cuts, demand has continued to decline. Concurrently, the housing supply has surged, with inventory in June and July hitting around four months and active home listings increasing 36.6% year-over-year in July. In August, the buyers' strike persisted with mortgage applications for home purchases falling to near-record lows, indicating that high home prices remain the primary deterrent for buyers."

        "summary": "In the article \"Treasury Department Aggressively Pushes Down Long-Term Interest Rates via Shift to T-bill Issuance and Bond Buybacks\" by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET, the US Treasury Department has embarked on two strategic measures to decrease long-term interest rates. This involves increasing short-term Treasury bill issuances and conducting bond buybacks, effectively swapping older long-term securities with new issues, which is not categorized as quantitative easing (QE). The shift to Treasury bills highlights the increased reliance on short-term debt, with T-bill yields soaring above 5% since mid-2023, surpassing the 10-year yield. This approach, more costly upfront, aims to stimulate the economy by reducing long-term borrowing costs, though it contradicts the Federal Reserve's policy of tightening rates to control inflation. Since the debt ceiling suspension in June 2023, T-bill issuances surged by $2 trillion, bringing their share of total marketable Treasury securities from 16.7% to 22.5% by May 2024. The buybacks, which began in April and intensified to weekly amounts between $2 billion and $4 billion, allow older securities to be retired and replaced without drastic price cuts. In one recent buyback, the Treasury repurchased a 1.25% 20-year bond at only 65.64 cents on the dollar, resulting in significant investor losses but stabilizing bond prices. While these moves potentially ease financial conditions and boost economic activity, they add inflationary pressures, complicating the Fed's objectives."

        "summary": "The article \"The Most Splendid Housing Bubbles in America, Aug 2024 Update: Prices Decelerate,\" by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street, provides an August 2024 update on housing prices across major US cities, revealing notable regional disparities. The section \"Below 2022 Peak: San Francisco, Phoenix, Seattle, Portland, Denver, Dallas, Las Vegas\" identifies a deceleration in housing prices in these seven key metropolitan areas. Specifically, San Francisco Bay Area experienced a 7.0% decrease from its May 2022 peak, Phoenix saw a 4.2% drop from June 2022, and Seattle and Portland both declined by 4.0% and 2.9% from May 2022 peaks. Denver and Dallas prices fell by 2.6% and 1.9% from May and June 2022 peaks, and Las Vegas saw a 0.4% decrease from July 2022. The next section, \"The Most Splendid Housing Bubbles by Metropolitan Area,\" utilizes the Case-Shiller Index to illustrate that single-family house prices in San Francisco remained unchanged month-to-month but increased 4.3% year-over-year, while condo prices slightly declined month-to-month but were up 1.0% year-over-year. Seattle noted a 0.6% month-to-month increase leading to a 6.7% year-over-year rise, and Phoenix experienced a 0.4% monthly increase and a 3.7% yearly gain. Ports on Denver, and Dallas had modest month-to-month gains along with low single-digit year-over-year increases, whereas Las Vegas showed a significant 1.2% monthly rise and an 8.6% yearly increase. The article further mentions Tampa, San Diego, Los Angeles, Washington DC, Boston, Miami, and New York all reaching record price highs, with substantial year-over-year growth rates ranging from 3.1% in Tampa to 9.0% in New York. To qualify as \"Most Splendid Housing Bubbles,\" metros must have experienced home-price inflation of 200% or more since 2000, with San Diego leading at 349%, followed by Los Angeles and Miami, while Chicago, with a 109% price increase since 2000, does not meet this threshold.

        "summary": "Manufacturing orders have shown resilience with new highs reached in 2024 following a minor dip in 2023 after the pandemic boom, indicating ongoing demand in various sectors. According to Wolf Richter from Wolf Street, new orders for durable goods in July rose by 9.9% from June, reversing the prior month\u2019s decrease caused by nondefense aircraft order cancellations at Boeing. Orders excluding Nondefense Aircraft & Parts fell by 0.6% from June\u2019s record high. For durable goods orders excluding both defense and nondefense aircraft, there was a 0.6% decrease in July from June\u2019s record, reflecting a milder slowdown in the latter half of 2023 before a recovery. Defense orders represented about 5.5% of total durable goods orders over the past year. The order backlog surged during the pandemic due to component shortages, particularly semiconductors, but most of these shortages have now resolved. Nonetheless, aircraft manufacturers still face parts shortages, leaving many planes incomplete, leading to a significant backlog for Nondefense Aircraft & Parts, while the overall backlog excluding these parts dipped in mid-2023 but grew slightly again in June and July. In the section about manufacturing orders by the largest categories of durable goods, orders for motor vehicles and parts hit new records in 2024 with a slight dip in July to $63.6 billion, marking a 1.9% year-over-year increase and 19% above 2019 levels. Machinery orders stabilized at $37.6 billion in July, 17% higher than in 2019. Fabricated metal products orders plateaued at $36.2 billion for four months, up 13% from 2019. Computers and electronic products orders reached a 14-year high at $25 billion in June and maintained that level in July, 2.5% above previous years and 11% higher than in 2019.

        "summary": "In the article \"The Rate Cuts Powell Dangled in Front of Markets May Slam into Inflationary Fiscal & Economic Policies of Whoever Is in the White House Next Year\" by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at future rate cuts, although the timing will depend on incoming data and the evolving economic outlook. While no specific mention was made of a September cut, markets anticipate a move backed by signals from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes. Powell noted that inflation has cooled and the labor market has moderated without significant layoffs. The Fed aims for a gradual approach to rate cuts but may opt for substantial cuts if the labor market weakens considerably. Upcoming economic reports, especially the August jobs report, will be crucial for the Fed's decisions. High market expectations for several rate cuts could be affected by inflationary pressures from future government policies, with the upcoming presidential election playing a significant role in the Fed's rate strategies depending on the winning candidate. Meanwhile in the Treasury market, the August 2 jobs report influenced movements, with yields rising slightly. Powell's speech didn't change expectations much, as a September rate cut was already priced in. The six-month Treasury yield dropped to 4.88% post-jobs report but settled at 4.92%, reflecting a misjudgment of early 2024 rate cuts. The one-year Treasury yield remained at 4.36%, slightly up from an August 2 low of 4.33%, factoring in anticipated cuts within its one-year outlook."

The inventory of completed new houses reached 99,000 in July, the highest since 2009 and about three times that during the price spike era from March 2021 to June 2022. Homebuilders, motivated to quickly sell these houses, are offering incentives and mortgage-rate buydowns, contributing to lower prices across the market. Total house inventories remained around 466,000 for three months, with a 7.3-month supply due to a sales uptick. In July, 64,000 houses were sold, marking increases from the previous year and pre-pandemic 2019, as builders capitalized on homeowners' high price expectations while seeing strong sales of new homes despite a decline in existing home sales. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of new house sales climbed to 739,000, the highest since May 2023. Builders, needing to sustain revenue, are compelled to build and sell houses continuously, contributing to the rising inventory of unsold completed houses which benefits the market but introduces risks. New house sales made up 20.7% of all house sales, the highest level since 2005, showing a shift as buyers opt for new houses over existing ones. This trend is highlighted in the section \"Homebuilders\u2019 sales take an ever-larger share from homeowners.\" The section \"Prices of new houses have dropped and are competitive with existing house prices\" explains that prices for new single-family homes have decreased since late 2022 as builders offer smaller, less elaborate homes and incentives like mortgage-rate buydowns, costing builders like Lennar an average of $47,100 per house. The median price of new houses in July was $418,300, lower than both the previous year and the 2022 peak, and roughly $10,000 less than the median price of existing single-family houses, which is expected to decrease seasonally for the rest of the year."

This increase in refinancing activity helps speed up the runoff of mortgage-backed securities from the Fed's balance sheet, potentially increasing the QT pace to $20 billion a month from the current $14 billion, further anticipated by future home sales and mortgage payoffs."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter discusses the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) preliminary annual benchmark revisions, indicating that nonfarm job creation for the 12 months through March was revised down by 818,000 jobs, resulting in a total of 2.08 million jobs created instead of the initially reported 2.90 million. This adjustment changes the average monthly payroll jobs added from 242,000 to 173,500, which, although lower than initially thought, still surpasses the 171,900 average monthly additions seen in 2018-2019. The reduction for April 2023 through March 2024 involved varied revisions across industries: private education and health services saw an upward revision of 87,000 jobs, transportation and warehousing increased by 56,400 jobs, while professional and business services and leisure and hospitality faced substantial downward revisions of 358,000 and 150,000 jobs respectively. Each year, the BLS aligns its employment estimates with state unemployment insurance tax records, and these preliminary revisions will be included in the final revisions due in February, which have historically differed significantly from the preliminary estimates. Notable examples include a combined increase of 840,000 for 2021 and 2022, and a decrease of 359,000 for 2023."

Efforts to sell these loans without substantial losses have failed, and even after marking down their value by hundreds of millions of dollars, the banks remain stuck with this highly risky debt. Both restructuring attempts and hopes for future business with Musk have not yielded solutions, leaving the banks holding onto the largest hung deal in history. Musk has admitted to overpaying for Twitter, and the current valuations are significantly lower than the purchase price."

        "summary": "The article on Wolf Street by Wolf Richter discusses the significant strides made by the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Federal Reserve (Fed) in their Quantitative Tightening (QT) efforts, highlighting how they have collectively withdrawn $4.4 trillion in liquidity from the markets. In the main section, it is noted that the ECB\u2019s balance sheet has decreased by \u20ac2.39 trillion or 27% from its peak, now standing at \u20ac6.45 trillion, the lowest level since August 2020. This reduction surpasses the Fed's $1.78 trillion decrease, and together they have removed $4.44 trillion in QE liquidity. In the \"Loans and Bonds\" section, the ECB's QT program is detailed, showing a 96% reduction (\u20ac2.1 trillion) in loan holdings from their peak, with just \u20ac87 billion remaining, the lowest since 2005. The bond QT, which began rolling off in March 2023, has resulted in an 11% (\u20ac524 billion) reduction from peak holdings, now at \u20ac4.44 trillion. The ECB's loan QT involved Long-Term Refinancing Operations (LTRO) and Targeted LTROs (TLTROs), particularly during the pandemic, with almost nonexistent TLTRO III loans now. The bond QT process, governed by the Asset Purchase Programme (APP) and the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP), aims for a gradual, predictable removal of excess liquidity, averaging around \u20ac37 billion per month without causing major market disruptions."

        "summary": "Retail sales have been increasingly driven by ecommerce, while brick-and-mortar stores have stagnated over the past two years, despite categories like autos, gasoline, and food starting to feel the shift towards online purchasing. According to Wolf Richter for Wolf Street, ecommerce sales in Q2 rose significantly by 6.6% from Q2 2023 and 15.7% from Q2 2022, reaching $282 billion, while brick-and-mortar sales increased only by 1.0% year-over-year, totaling $1.85 trillion. Since the end of 2018, ecommerce sales have surged by 121.6%, whereas physical store sales have grown by just 28.6%. Although physical retail rebounded during 2021 and 2022, inflation has impacted growth, and since Q2 2022, brick-and-mortar sales have stagnated. Notably, Walmart reported a robust 22% year-over-year growth in ecommerce sales, highlighting a trend towards ecommerce's dominance. On a seasonally adjusted basis, ecommerce sales hit a record $292 billion in Q2, commanding 16.0% of total retail sales. Some stuff is still hard to sell online, such as gasoline and groceries, despite grocery sales being a significant portion of retail trade. Auto dealerships have seen a shift towards online sales, especially with used vehicles, and companies like Tesla are disrupting traditional dealership models by selling EVs directly to consumers online. The section \"Ecommerce did that\" highlights how ecommerce has heavily impacted traditional retail, with sectors like department stores and furniture retailers moving online. Department stores' contributions to retail sales have drastically dropped from 10% in 1992 to just 1.8% as of July, underscoring the transformative impact ecommerce has had on the retail industry."

To help stabilize the market, Chinese authorities have decided to stop releasing daily data on fund flows from foreign investors, effective immediately. This data has been a crucial sentiment indicator, showing a consistent withdrawal of funds by foreign entities, including Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway reducing its stake in BYD. So far this year, Bloomberg reports that foreign fund flows in Chinese markets have been negative. As a result, investors must now rely on quarterly reports from the People\u2019s Bank of China, which are delayed and provide only broad metrics. The article also details how Chinese authorities have repeatedly intervened in the stock market using state-controlled institutional investors, liquidity injections, and warnings against short-selling. Despite these efforts, any resulting gains tend to be short-lived, with renewed sell-offs and further outflows from foreign investors often following."

In \"A Big Week for Stocks,\" Richter details significant gains in big tech stocks, including an 18.9% and 25.9% increase for Nvidia and an 8.1% rise for Tesla, contrasting with Alphabet's declines due to regulatory pressures. The \"Magnificent 7\" stocks (Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla) collectively gained 6.2% for the week, adding nearly $1.4 trillion despite being down by $1.49 trillion since mid-July. Nvidia, despite its recent surge, remains 7.7% below its all-time high, reflecting similar volatility as Tesla, which is still 48% down from its peak. The S&P 500, driven largely by these stocks, gained 3.9% for the week, recovering nearly to mid-July levels and up 16.5% year-to-date. The Nasdaq Composite rose 5.3% for the week, remaining 4.7% below its July peak, while the Russell 2000 increased by 2.9% but is still 12.9% below its November 2021 high due to the poor performance of many smaller companies. The heavy concentration of these stocks in the S&P 500 poses a systemic risk but is somewhat mitigated by global investment, contrasting with the localized impact of the Dotcom Bubble burst."

This contributed to an overall 6.8% decrease from June, marking the lowest level since May 2020. Despite this, multifamily housing starts surged by 11.7% in July, reflecting a 45% increase from their March lows, even amidst challenges like tight lending conditions and higher mortgage rates at 7%. Overall, residential construction starts are down 16% year-over-year, primarily due to the dip in single-family starts. The \"What we\u2019re worried about and what we\u2019re not worried about\" section emphasizes the slowdown in residential construction from 2021 and 2022 highs. Multifamily construction reached multidecade highs, raising concerns about overbuilding, as many new high-end units enter the market. Despite the broader downturn in commercial real estate, there are signs that multifamily construction might have stabilized in the spring. Single-family home construction, while cooling from its prior pace, remains solid year-to-date through June, performing above pre-pandemic levels and likely to continue this trend."

In July, retail sales increased by 1.0% from June and 4.0% year-over-year, totaling $724 billion, driven by a 1.0% rise in e-commerce from June and a 7.4% increase year-over-year, making it a major growth contributor. The section \"Big price drops in goods make these retail sales even stronger\" details how declining goods prices have led to stronger retail sales since consumers are purchasing more at lower prices, enhancing consumer spending and GDP growth.

New and used vehicle dealers saw a partial recovery in July with a 0.4% increase despite having flat dollar sales over the past 18 months due to dropping prices. E-commerce and nonstore retailers, making up 17% of retail sales, saw a 1.0% monthly increase and a 7.4% year-over-year rise.

In July 2024, Toronto experienced a significant drop in single-family home prices by 15% from their peak, with condo prices reaching multiyear lows. In contrast, cities like Calgary and Quebec City saw new highs in their housing markets.

According to Wolf Richter, home sales in Canada decreased by 0.7% from June to July and are still about 10% below the 10-year average, even with Bank of Canada rate cuts. The sales drop in Calgary and Greater Toronto Area was offset by increases in Edmonton and Hamilton-Burlington, with sales up 4.8% compared to July of the previous year.

In the section \"Beneath the Skin of CPI Inflation,\" it is noted that housing CPI saw a resurgence after June's anomaly, contributing to broader month-to-month CPI acceleration. \"Services CPI Bounces Back from Outlier\" discusses how Core Services CPI, comprising 65% of total CPI, rose by 0.31%, while Durable Goods CPI's decline slowed. \"Month-to-Month Basis\" highlights a rise in Core CPI by 0.17%, driven by core services, while food-at-home CPI increased by 0.13%, and energy prices remained stable. The \"Year-Over-Year Basis\" section reports a 4.9% rise in Core Services CPI, a 4.1% drop in Durable Goods CPI, and a 3.2% increase in Core CPI, while overall CPI rose by 2.9%. \"Core CPI, Month-to-Month\" notes the 0.17% increase in July, driven by core services. The \"Core Services CPI Bounced Back from Outliers\" section mentions a 3.8% annualized increase, with a six-month deceleration to 4.2%.

This change was driven by an extreme base effect from the previous year, July 2023, which saw unusually high figures replaced by much lower ones in 2024. This base effect sharply affected the year-over-year metrics, with the Services PPI increasing by only 2.6% in July compared to 3.5% in June. The Core Goods PPI remained stable, showing a slight annual increase around 2.2%. Going forward, the base effect is expected to reverse, impacting PPI metrics through the rest of 2024. The overall PPI for final demand decelerated, driven by a significant 1.9% drop in the Services PPI from June to July, although the PPI for finished core goods excluding food and energy products showed controlled, moderate acceleration. The Core PPI dipped by 0.6% from June to July, mainly due to the decline in Services PPI. This transition from a favorable base effect to a challenging one will continue influencing PPI readings moving forward."

Since allegations by short-sellers in February 2023, B. Riley has faced scrutiny over proper disclosure of asset risks and possible insider trading, particularly involving founder Bryant Riley and business partner Brian Kahn. The disclosed Q2 net loss ranged from $435 to $475 million, including significant write-downs and charges on investments, inventory impairments, and deferred income taxes. Additionally, the company revealed it has $2.16 billion in outstanding debt against $1.1 billion in total cash and investments. Formed in June 2014 via a reverse merger and listed on the Nasdaq in July 2015, B.

The article starts by explaining the difference between the New York Federal Reserve's \"delinquency transition rates\" and month-end \"delinquency rates.\" While the former measures the percentage of balances transitioning into delinquency over the past 12 months, the latter reflects the level of delinquent balances at a specific point in time. Highlighting data points, the New York Fed's Q2 report showed that approximately 9.1% of credit card balances transitioned into delinquency, often misreported as a delinquency rate, whereas actual delinquency rates stood at 2.81% for bank cards, 4.44% for private-label cards, and 2.96% for credit cards at commercial banks. Remarkably, delinquency rates have dropped for the fourth consecutive month, with June figures from Equifax showing 2.83% for bank cards and 4.44% for private-label cards. The article discusses how credit card balances have surged by $27 billion or 2.4% in Q2, totaling $1.14 trillion, indicating robust consumer spending and rising prices. However, the growth in credit card and other consumer loan balances has been modest over the past two decades, with \"other\" loans increasing by 14% and credit card balances by 63%, despite a 73% rise in CPI inflation and 16% population growth. The relative burden of credit card and \"other\" balances on disposable income remains stable, accounting for 8.1%. Banks continue to show eagerness to open new accounts, with the total credit limit rising by $379 billion year-over-year to $4.92 trillion. Lastly, the article is part of a series that also covers auto loans, HELOCs, mortgage debt, and overall household debt, offering a comprehensive view of consumer credit for Q2."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter discusses the state of auto loans in the second quarter, emphasizing the steadiness of delinquency rates. In \"Auto Loans,\" it is noted that a significant number of consumers are paying cash for vehicles to eschew high-interest rates. The \"Burden of Auto Loans\" section reveals that the ratio of auto loan debt to household disposable income has dipped to 7.79%, the lowest since Q1 2021 and, excluding that period, the lowest since 2015 due to faster-growing disposable incomes. In the \"Subprime Lending\" section, subprime loans, now primarily linked with used vehicle financing, represent only 14% of new vehicle loan originations. The appeal of securitizing subprime auto loans into ABS has waned due to higher Treasury yields and increasing delinquency rates, causing financial distress and bankruptcies among specialized subprime dealer/lenders. The slight decrease in the subprime 60-plus day delinquency rate in June is overshadowed by elevated rates compared to the previous year. Meanwhile, prime loans maintain low delinquency rates below 0.3%. Lastly, the \"Delinquencies in Q2\" segment highlights that overall auto-loan delinquency rates have stabilized despite the upward pressure from subprime-related delinquencies. The total auto loan and lease balance for both new and used vehicles grew by only 0.6% in Q2, a modest 2.8% year-over-year increase, attributed to lower financing amounts and more cash transactions amid declining used-vehicle prices and reduced new vehicle prices."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article, authored by Wolf Richter, examines how Blackstone profited massively from its investment in Bumble through a strategic maneuver described as a \"pump-n-dump,\" capitalizing on public market enthusiasm to gain over $2 billion while public investors suffered significant losses with Bumble's share price plummeting by 94% since its IPO, which is referred to as consensual hallucination because there were no forced victims. Bumble Inc.'s Q2 earnings report in the WOLF STREET section detailed a downward revision of its revenue growth outlook to 1-2% from the previously expected 8-11%, leading to a historic drop in share prices. The company explained the adjustment as necessary for boosting user growth, customer value, and long-term revenue, with Bumble's own app revenue rising by 4.8% and Badoo's revenue declining by 2.2%, despite an increase in total paying users by 14% and a 9% decline in revenue per user. Bumble's net income saw an increase to $37.7 million for the quarter, although the company\u2019s shares have significantly fallen since their initial surge post-IPO in February 2021, landing Bumble on the \"Imploded Stocks\" list in March 2022 after substantial declines. Blackstone\u2019s initial investment in Bumble stemmed from its 2019 acquisition of a majority stake in MagicLab for $2 billion, a highly profitable move as it made about $4 billion through progressive share sales while the public watched share values decrease. Recent filings show Blackstone continues to divest, now holding approximately 50 million shares."

Mortgage balances saw a modest increase of $77 billion or 0.6%, driven by higher home prices and larger financed amounts, reaching $12.5 trillion. HELOC balances showed notable growth, climbing 1.1% for the quarter and 11.8% year-over-year to $380 billion, yet remain historically low compared to the past. Around 1.8 million HELOCs were initiated between 2023 and the first half of 2024, offering a cost-effective borrowing alternative but posing risks if heavily used during economic downturns. The burden of mortgage debt on households, measured against disposable income, has slightly decreased, maintaining around 60%\u2014a historically low ratio. Serious delinquencies in mortgage balances have dropped to 0.57%, while HELOC delinquencies hit their lowest levels since 2006 at 0.36%. Overall, 30-day mortgage delinquencies rose slightly to 3.3%, and HELOC delinquencies edged down to 2.1%. Foreclosures have stabilized, exhibiting a \"frying-pan\" pattern, with numbers below pre-pandemic levels and unlikely to become significant unless there is a major economic downturn. Low unemployment, bolstered by new labor force entrants, helps keep foreclosures in check, as homeowners with equity or those employed can avoid or manage mortgage defaults."

        "summary": "The article \"Used Car & Truck Prices Suddenly Bounce, Inventories Tighten: End of Historic Plunge that Pushed CPI Inflation Down?\" by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street discusses the recent uptick in used car and truck prices following a notable decline that had significantly contributed to reducing the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation. This price rebound is primarily due to tightening inventories, marked by a 25% decline in June from 2019 levels, and a slowdown in off-lease vehicle supplies expected to last until 2026. In July, Manheim's Used Vehicle Value Index reported a 2.8% seasonally adjusted increase, and wholesale prices saw an unusual 0.6% rise. This shift is in sharp contrast with typical price declines during this period. Notably, prices for both electric vehicles (EVs) and internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles increased, counter to the anticipated declines, though EV prices still have room to fall post-pandemic spike. Though the retail used vehicle CPI usually trails behind wholesale trends, it is expected to align with these auction price increases shortly. The upcoming Bureau of Labor Statistics' release of the July CPI will provide further insights into these evolving trends."

The article highlights that household debt rose by $109 billion, reaching $17.8 trillion, driven by increasing home and car prices as well as population growth, marking just a 0.6% rise from Q1, the smallest since Q2 2023. The \"Relative Burden of Household Debt\" section notes that household debt has become less burdensome as disposable income grew by 0.9% in Q2 2024, surpassing the 0.6% debt growth. This left household debt at 85.2% of disposable income, historically low compared to the Financial Crisis. In \"Delinquencies Still Lower than Normal, Barely Tick Up,\" delinquency rates experienced a minor increase to 3.95% for debts 30 days or more overdue, while the 90-day delinquency rate stayed at an unprecedented low of 1.83%, maintaining healthier financial health than pre-pandemic levels. The section \"Consumers with Third-Party Collections Still Near Record Lows\" shows a slight rise in third-party collections to 4.85%, still near historic lows, indicating stable consumer debt management. Finally, the \"Consumers with Bankruptcies Still Near Record Lows\" section details that bankruptcy filings remain significantly below pre-pandemic levels, with 136,180 filings in Q2 compared to 234,280 in Q2 2019.

Inflation Pressures Still On.\" Wolf Richter reports that the ISM Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) and S&P\u2019s US Services PMI both indicated values above 50 in July, signaling growth with S&P\u2019s services PMI at 55.0, close to June\u2019s 55.3. This growth is attributed to solid new order increases and higher employment levels, benefiting from a shift in consumer spending from goods to services including travel, recreation, healthcare, and financial services. While input cost inflation rose due to higher wages and transportation costs, output inflation slightly decelerated. The service sector's expansion is expected to contribute to a 2.2% annualized GDP growth rate. The ISM Services PMI rose to 51.4% in July from 48.8% in June, indicating an increase in business activity, new orders, and exports. This highlights the significant role of the service sector in driving the economy, especially as manufacturing growth stagnates post-pandemic."

        "summary": "In the Wolf Street article \"Berkshire Dumped Nearly Half its Apple Shares plus Other Stocks into Final Burst of Rally, Bought T-Bills,\" it is highlighted that Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett, significantly reduced its holdings in Apple, selling nearly half of its shares during a market rally, alongside other stocks, signaling a potential market sell-off. This large-scale selling was more substantial than anticipated by Edward Jones Investments. In Q2 2024, as detailed in \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET,\" Berkshire continued its trend of net stock sales for the seventh consecutive quarter, divesting $76 billion and rapidly reallocating the proceeds into Treasury bills, which saw an $81 billion increase, coinciding with a market downturn. The section \"Cash is king\" reveals that Berkshire's T-bill holdings surged by $81 billion to $235 billion, earning $3 billion in interest income at a 5.3% average rate, thereby surpassing Warren Buffett's forecast of exceeding $200 billion in cash and T-bills by the end of Q2. The company's total cash, including T-bills and cash equivalents, reached $277 billion, more than doubling since Q1 2023. \"Ditching Stocks\" explains that Berkshire divested $75 billion in stocks in Q2, notably reducing its Apple holdings to 400 million shares and selling 8.8% of its Bank of America holdings, focusing its stock investments mainly in Apple, Bank of America, American Express, Coca-Cola, and Chevron. The \"Share buybacks grind down\" section notes a significant reduction in share buybacks to $345 million in Q2 from $2.57 billion in Q1, implying that Buffett may no longer see the shares as a good value following a 44% price surge in 2023. Finally, the \"Investment income drops, operating income rises\" section reports a 15% increase in operating income to $11.6 billion year-over-year, driven mainly by the insurance sector and GEICO's underwriting profits. However, investment income dropped by 28% to $18.7 billion in Q2, resulting in a 15% year-over-year decrease in net income to $30.3 billion."

Nonetheless, the land retained some value, partially offsetting the financial loss, reflecting a broader trend of declining office property values due to increased remote working. UBS purchased a 925,000-square-foot office building at 135 West 50th Street in Manhattan for $332 million in 2006 and later acquired the land beneath it for $279 million. In 2019, they sold the land to Safehold for $285 million while retaining a long-term lease on the building, anticipating high office rents. Despite investing $76 million in renovations completed in 2021, the building ended up only 35% leased as the office market suffered from remote work trends. Efforts to sell the building were unsuccessful, leading UBS to eventually sell it through an online auction for $8.5 million. Although the total returns from the property amounted to $293.5 million, depreciation rules softened the financial blow on UBS's balance sheet."

Mag 7 -$2.26 Trillion from Peak, Semis Crushed, Nasdaq Bloodied\" by Wolf Richter on Wolf Street addresses the recent downturn in the stock market driven by fluctuating hopes around Federal Reserve rate cuts. Initially, stock market enthusiasm since December 2023 was fueled by expectations of multiple rate cuts in 2024, leading to a significant market rally. However, on July 10, sentiment shifted as anticipated rate cuts did not materialize, causing stock prices to plunge. The \"Mag 7\" stocks\u2014Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla\u2014have collectively fallen $2.26 trillion from their peak valuations. Highlighting this, Amazon\u2019s shares dropped an additional 8.8% following disappointing earnings, contributing to a 16.5% decline since July 10. Intel suffered the most significant hit with a 26% plunge in its share price due to falling revenues and other financial challenges, marking its worst day since 1974. The article notes that since the yield curve inversion in 2022, recession predictions have persisted but have yet to materialize. The shift in market focus back to fundamentals revealed unsustainable valuations that had driven recent stock market peaks. Notably, the Magnificent 7 companies saw a sharp decline of 2.4% in a single day, equating to a loss of $369 billion. Over 17 trading days, their combined market capitalization dropped to $14.7 trillion, a 13.3% decrease from their July 10 peak. The semiconductor sector was particularly hard hit, with Intel's significant drop and the PHLX Semiconductor Index down 22% from its peak, although the index remains up 10% year-to-date. Despite recent sell-offs, the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 Index still show substantial gains year-to-date, underscoring that the market correction, driven by refocusing on economic fundamentals amidst Fed policy uncertainties, has not yet erased earlier advances."

In \"Why suddenly?\" the article explains how foreign investments, particularly by Warren Buffett, drove a 62% surge in the Nikkei index earlier in the year before cooling off. The BOJ's policy rate hike to 0.25% and QT measures amid a core CPI of 2.6% in June underscored the tightening monetary environment. As investors sought safer assets amid the sell-off, longer-term Japanese Government Bond yields fell to 0.96%, highlighting erratic market reactions and the end of Japan\u2019s era of easy money."

The increase in the unemployment rate is linked to the slower absorption of a large influx of immigrants into the labor market. Job growth has slowed, resembling the pace from 2017 to 2019.

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter critiques the New York Times for misleadingly sensationalizing the sale of a 23-floor Manhattan office building, stating it sold at a 97.5% discount. The article argues that while the building's value has plummeted, the land still retains substantial worth, with UBS avoiding significant financial damage and suffering only reputational harm. In 2006, UBS acquired the Manhattan office tower for $332 million, and in 2019, they sold the land below the building to Safehold for $285 million, retaining the building through a ground lease with Safehold. Despite investing $76 million in renovations with hopes of rising office rents, the building's value declined due to market shifts and work-from-home trends, leading to reduced occupancy and revenue. By 2024, UBS struggled to sell the underperforming asset and eventually auctioned it for $8.5 million, resulting in a capital loss of roughly 28% from their initial and renovation investments. However, depreciation rules could mitigate the financial impact on their statements. The article highlights a broader real estate market trend, with a similar case in Chicago where an office building sold for a fraction of its initial investment after separating land and leasehold interests, emphasizing the declining value of buildings versus land. The New York Times inaccurately calculated the discount rate by only considering the building's sale proceeds without accounting for the land's value, leading to the false impression of an enormous discount and highlighting the need for accurate reporting and knowledgeable editing."

The \"Inflation in construction has abated\" section notes that while construction costs had spiked from mid-2021 to 2022, they stabilized in early 2023, with the Producer Price Index for nonresidential buildings remaining flat or slightly negative since late 2023 after previously peaking at a 24% increase in mid-2022. Overall, the investment trend underscores the move towards local production capabilities and increased automation to counteract supply chain vulnerabilities."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article, \"How Powell Kept a September Rate Cut up in the Air: It Will All Depend on the Data till Then\" by Wolf Richter, delves into Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's measured approach towards potential interest rate cuts, emphasizing that such decisions hinge on forthcoming economic data. In the section by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET, it is noted that market expectations for a 25-basis-point rate cut by September were high, but Powell, during a post-FOMC press conference, did not confirm these expectations. He stressed that future rate cuts would depend on inflation improvements or labor market declines, while high inflation and a stable economy might delay cuts. In Powell's own words, he elaborates on the balanced yet cautious strategy, highlighting the necessity of ongoing data assessment. While recent data improves confidence, the Fed is not yet ready to reduce the federal funds rate, as premature action could reverse inflation progress or an undue delay could weaken economic activity. Overall, Powell's stance is one of prudence, with decisions meticulously guided by economic indicators without making immediate rate cut commitments."

In the section \u201cWhere the heck is the September rate cut?\u201d, it highlights the absence of any indication of a rate cut in the latest statement, emphasizing that Fed Chair Jerome Powell will need to address this in an upcoming press conference, while reiterating the Fed\u2019s commitment to its 2 percent inflation target. The section \u201cWhat changed in the statement\u201d notes modifications in the Fed\u2019s language on labor market conditions and inflation, with job gains reportedly moderating and inflation described as somewhat elevated but making progress towards the target. The \u201cQT continues at the slower pace\u201d section explains the Federal Reserve's slower Quantitative Tightening strategy, with Treasury roll-offs capped and Mortgage-Backed Securities continuing without a cap, a deliberate adjustment following pitfalls in the 2019 repo market. Additionally, the article notes today's meeting lacked a \"Summary of Economic Projections (SEP)\" or a dot plot, which will next be released after the September 17-18 meeting. Finally, the \"The whole statement\" section summarizes the Fed's continued vigilance on economic data before making rate adjustments, reaffirming their long-term goals of maximum employment and a 2 percent inflation rate, and the decision to keep rates unchanged was unanimous, with Austan D. Goolsbee voting as an alternate member."

        "summary": "The article from Wolf Street titled \"Bank of Japan Hikes by 25 Basis Points and Starts QT: Too Little Too Late but in Right Direction to Prop Up the Plunging Yen\" by Wolf Richter discusses the Bank of Japan's recent policy adjustments. To combat the yen's prolonged depreciation and rising inflation, BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda announced a raise in the policy rate by 25 basis points to 0.25% and the commencement of quantitative tightening. Despite these measures, the real policy rate remains deeply negative as the new rate is still below the Core CPI of 2.6%. As part of the quantitative tightening strategy, the BOJ will reduce its holdings of Japanese Government Bonds at a gradual pace, eventually reaching a monthly runoff rate of about \u00a53 trillion by early 2026. This is notably slower compared to the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s QT approach. Although the BOJ's moves are more conservative, they have started to stabilize the yen, as evidenced by its recent appreciation against the U.S. dollar. Overall, while these steps are a cautious start and represent a shift in the right direction, they are considered insufficient to fully address the broader economic challenges."

Nvidia experienced a 7% drop today and a 23% decrease since July 10 but saw an upturn in after-hours trading following Microsoft's announcement of its AI infrastructure spending plans, suggesting potential market reaction favoring Nvidia. Microsoft's fiscal Q4 earnings report showed a 15% rise in revenue to $64.7 billion and a 10% increase in net income to $22 billion. However, Intelligent Cloud and Azure's growth did not meet expectations, contributing to a 7% initial decline in Microsoft shares after hours, which later recovered to a 4% decrease, marking a 12.5% decline from its peak. The \"Another crummy day for the Mag 7\" section highlights a further 1.8% drop in the group's market cap, losing $274 billion, with their combined market cap now at $14.9 trillion. Notably, Nvidia lost $198 billion before gaining 4.6% after hours, while Microsoft's and Tesla's declines also contributed. Lastly, the \"On a side note: Fed day\" section indicates that the market expects a rate cut from the Federal Reserve in September with certainty, but the Fed may try to temper these expectations, introducing uncertainty about the expected move."

The section \"Below 2022 Peak\" details how cities like San Francisco, Seattle, Phoenix, Portland, Denver, Dallas, and Las Vegas have not reached their 2022 peak values, indicating either a downtrend or stabilization. However, the section \"New Highs\" highlights that cities such as Miami, Los Angeles, San Diego, Boston, New York, Tampa, Washington DC, and Chicago have seen new high prices, reflecting robust or rising demand. According to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Indices for May, covered in \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET,\" home prices increased across all 20 metropolitan areas surveyed, despite the slower pace of growth compared to previous months and a backdrop of declining home sales and active listings surge. Notably, prices remained below their 2022 peaks in seven metro areas including the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, and Phoenix, while eight metros like New York and Tampa hit new highs. In \"The most splendid housing bubbles by metropolitan area,\" the article illustrates significant monthly and annual home price increases across various cities, with San Diego topping the list due to a 346% price inflation since 2000. The Case-Shiller Index employs a \"sales pairs\" method for measuring this price inflation, which has significantly outpaced consumer price inflation. Six metros, including Chicago and Charlotte, experienced less dramatic price inflation and did not qualify as \"most splendid housing bubbles,\" though Chicago still saw substantial growth with a 46% price increase since March 2020."

Badcock, leading to both companies declaring bankruptcy just seven months later. This situation underscores the critical role of share buybacks, without which Conn\u2019s might have avoided its financial downfall. The company, which sold furniture, appliances, electronics, and mattresses across 552 stores, also operated as a subprime lender enabling high-risk customers to finance their purchases. Despite its claims otherwise, high-risk lending was crucial to boosting sales. Conn's bankruptcy could have been avoided if it had not spent $345 million on share buybacks from 2016 to 2023, a move that depleted cash reserves and increased debt, ultimately hastening the company\u2019s collapse. In December 2023, Conn's further strained its finances by acquiring another struggling subprime retailer, W.S. Badcock, in an effort to mask a 23% revenue decline since 2015 amidst increased lending to subprime customers and rampant inflation. This acquisition led to the liquidation of both companies within seven months. Conn's history of periodic credit issues and stock collapses due to its risky business model contributed significantly to its eventual downfall."

In \"Shakeout & Price Cuts in the Auto Industry?\", Richter discusses the shakeout within the U.S. auto industry, marked by price cuts and shifts in consumer behavior due to rising prices. He notes the unexpected rise in new auto sales and unprecedented inflation rates for used vehicles, significantly impacting overall consumer spending patterns. Reader comments reflect varied opinions on the Fed's decision and sarcastic takes on the U.S.-Japan comparison, with some humorously critiquing each other's understanding of Japan's economic context.

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter addresses the alarming surge in the US national debt, which has reached $35 trillion, reflecting a $1 trillion increase in under seven months and a 50% rise since January 2020. Despite significant economic growth post-2020, the debt accumulation rate remains worrying. Discussing the relationship between the economy's size (GDP) and national debt, the article highlights that the debt-to-GDP ratio, although slightly dipping to 121.7% in Q2 2024 from its peak of 133% in Q2 2020, still has not returned to pre-pandemic levels. The ratio\u2019s erosion during recessions, due to rising debt and declining GDP, remains a concern, especially with predictions of worsening during future economic downturns. Notably, interest payments as a percentage of tax receipts have dipped due to increased tax revenues and are expected to decline further. In the \"T-bills' share of Treasury securities held by the public\" section, the article outlines that $5.76 trillion in Treasury bills are currently in circulation, and T-bills now account for 20.7% of the securities held by the public, a decrease from 22.5% in March. Out of the total $35 trillion Treasury securities, $7.16 trillion are held by government entities and $27.84 trillion by the public, including international investors and financial institutions."

According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, revisions raised May\u2019s annualized core PCE from 1.0% to 1.5%, while June's rate accelerated to 2.2%, driven by stable durable goods prices. Over six months, core PCE increased to 3.4%, exceeding the core CPI's 3.3% rise in June. The \"In summary, year-over-year\" section reports that the overall PCE price index, including food and energy, rose 2.5% year-over-year in June, with energy prices nearly flat and food prices unchanged over four months. The core PCE price index ascended 2.6%, above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, while core services PCE steadied at 3.9% after May's upward revision to 4.0%, consistent since December. The durable goods PCE price index fell 2.9% year-over-year, less than May's 3.1% drop, with the core services index's six-month average adjusted to 4.5%, higher than late 2023's range, indicating a re-accelerating economy with rising core services inflation impacting housing, healthcare, and transportation. The durable goods PCE index remained unchanged in June after a 9.1% annualized drop from April to May, reflecting tendencies for slight negative ranges in normal periods due to manufacturing efficiencies and globalization."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter discusses how the prices of new houses have fallen below those of existing houses due to significantly increased inventory, reaching levels not seen since 2009. In the article's section \"Prices of new houses fall below prices of existing houses,\" it is noted that the median price for new homes is now lower than that of existing single-family houses, with builders offering lower-priced options and incentives like costly mortgage-rate buydowns. The three-month moving average of the median new home price has dropped to $412,667 as of June, slightly below the previous year and 6.7% below its peak. Builders face the challenge of aligning prices and construction schedules with fluctuating mortgage rates and market demands, with the key question being the rate at which new home prices will change relative to existing home prices in the latter half of the year. In the section \"Inventory piles up. Exactly what the housing market needs.,\" the article highlights that builders have increased their inventory to 475,000 houses, the highest since 2008, with a surge in supply pushing prices downward and making housing more affordable. This includes a peak inventory of completed houses reaching 98,000, showing builders' urgency to sell. The market benefits from this increased supply, providing better deals on new homes for buyers struggling with the existing home market. Despite reduced sales, builders remain committed to constructing houses and negotiating sales, ensuring ongoing market supply."

        "summary": "Wolf Richter's article on Wolf Street, titled \"Here Comes the Inventory of Vacant Homes: With Buyers on Strike despite Lower Mortgage Rates, Supply Spikes to Highest in 4 Years. Sales Drop Further except at High End,\" examines the dynamics of the housing market as potential buyers remain reluctant despite lower mortgage rates. The supply of vacant homes has surged to its highest level in four years, marking a shift from a seller's to a buyer's market, acknowledged by the National Association of Realtors (NAR). Despite mortgage rates dropping to around 6.8%, existing home sales have declined significantly, with a notable 5.4% drop in June both month-over-month and year-over-year. This decline has led to a substantial 23.4% year-over-year increase in inventory in June, with active listings spiking by 36.7% in various metro areas such as Tampa, Orlando, and Denver. Homes are also staying longer on the market, resulting in a rise in available inventory from 3.1 months the previous year to 4.1 months in June. Furthermore, 37.6% of active listings saw price reductions, the highest percentage for any June except June 2022. Despite the overall decline in home sales, the section \"Median price was shifted up by the surge in sales of high-end homes\" explains that the median home price has been pushed up due to an increase in high-end home sales, particularly those priced over $1 million. Sales in all other price categories decreased, with the largest drops in homes below $750,000. This trend was especially noted in expensive markets like the San Francisco Bay Area, driven by wealthy buyers often paying in cash, partly fueled by the AI boom and stock market gains. As a result, the median price of single-family homes hit a new high of $432,700, with the median condo price rising to a record $371,700. However, future large price accelerations are considered unlikely due to an approaching market balance."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter highlights the stark contrast between different sectors of the financial market. In the section \"CRE Gets Strangled,\" it is noted that commercial real estate is facing significant distress, with many properties struggling to refinance debt. The section \"Corporate Bankruptcies Highest since 2010\" reveals that corporate bankruptcies have soared to levels not seen since 2010, suggesting that many companies are grappling with tighter credit conditions and finding it difficult to manage their debt loads. Interestingly, the section \"Junk Bonds & Broad Financial Conditions in La-La-Land\" indicates that despite these troubling indicators, junk bonds and broader financial conditions appear unusually positive. High demand for BB-rated junk bonds has driven their yield spreads to their lowest point since 2007, signaling investor confidence in higher-rated junk debt. However, the lower end of the junk-bond market, particularly CCC-rated bonds, remains troubled with high yield spreads and rising bankruptcy rates. Leveraged loans have also seen an increase in distressed debt exchanges, where companies negotiate haircuts with lenders to avoid bankruptcies, still indicating significant financial distress. Despite these issues in specific areas, the Chicago Fed's National Financial Conditions Index shows that overall financial conditions have loosened to their most relaxed state since November 2021, despite the Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to tighten them. This divergence highlights a significant mismatch between the broader financial markets and the underlying economic challenges, particularly in commercial real estate and among companies with lower credit ratings."

        "summary": "The article by Wolf Richter on Wolf Street discusses the sharp decline in small-cap stocks and a significant loss in the Magnificent 7 stocks, which collectively lost $1.3 trillion over seven days. The week saw notable sell-offs, with the S&P 500 falling 2.0%, the Nasdaq composite dropping 3.6%, and the Nasdaq 100 declining 4.0%. The Magnificent 7 stocks, which include Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Tesla, and Meta, experienced substantial declines individually, with Nvidia falling 12.3%, Microsoft 6.3%, Alphabet 6.9%, Amazon 8.3%, Tesla 9.2%, and Meta 10.8%. Despite a brief 5.3% spike, the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks ended the week up just 1.7%, reaching levels last seen in February 2021. The Nasdaq 100, despite its recent 4.0% weekly drop and 5.6% decrease from its July 10 peak, remains up 16% year-to-date and 51.5% since early 2021. Similarly, the S&P 500, down 2% for the week, has surged 47% since early 2021 and 53% since October 2022. Despite these sell-offs, the article highlights that the losses concentrated in the tech-heavy Magnificent 7 were particularly significant and relatively unnoticed by the broader public."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article, \"Non-Tesla EV Sales +45% in Q2 YoY in California, Tesla -24%: People Have Had it with Musk\u2019s Bullshit about California and San Francisco?\", outlines a significant shift in California's electric vehicle (EV) landscape during the second quarter of 2023. Despite the overall EV market experiencing a slight decline of 1.3% year-over-year, non-Tesla EV sales surged by 45% to 49,232 vehicles, while Tesla's sales plummeted by 24% to 52,211. This shift is partly attributed to increasing consumer dissatisfaction with Elon Musk's controversial comments about California and San Francisco. Tesla\u2019s Model Y saw a 15% drop in sales, and Model 3 sales collapsed by 59%, partly due to rebate qualification issues; meanwhile, Cybertruck sales reached 3,048 units. In \"The auto market in California,\" the article notes that internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle sales dropped by 2.1%, and EVs managed to increase their market share to 21.9%. \"California sales matter for Tesla\" reveals that Q2 2023 California registrations represented 14.8% of Tesla\u2019s global deliveries. Without the 24% decline in California, Tesla\u2019s global deliveries would have only decreased by 1.4% rather than 4.8% year-over-year. In \"Musk\u2019s bullshit was funny until it whacked Tesla sales,\" the article criticizes Musk's history of controversial and financially impactful statements, including his forced Twitter purchase and the 2018 tweet about taking Tesla private, for which he faced SEC consequences. These antics, alongside Musk's comments about California, have provoked consumer backlash, similar to boycotts faced by other brands, leading to increased competition from various automakers and a rise in non-Tesla EV purchases. Consequently, Musk has alienated many former Tesla enthusiasts in California."

        "summary": "In July, Wolf Street highlighted the growing concern over US debt nearing $35 trillion and the critical role of foreign investors in purchasing this expanding debt. Despite a 1.1% rise from April to May and a 9.0% increase year-over-year, bringing foreign holdings to $8.13 trillion, the share of US debt held by foreign investors has decreased from 33% in 2015 to 22% in 2023. The article points out that foreign entities have increasingly invested in US Treasury securities, with the largest six financial centers, including the UK and Switzerland, seeing a 13.4% increase to $2.37 trillion. However, some holdings belong to US entities managed offshore. Japan, with $1.13 trillion, saw a 2.9% increase despite selling USD to support the yen, while China and Hong Kong\u2019s combined holdings decreased to $986 billion after a 7.3% drop. In contrast, Euro Area countries, primarily Belgium and Luxembourg, have significantly increased holdings to $1.60 trillion, a 14.8% rise year-over-year. The article also notes notable annual increases in the UK's holdings by 19.3% to $723 billion and Canada's by 33% to $354 billion, while Taiwan reached a record $263 billion with a 9.8% annual increase. Although India's holdings slightly decreased, they have multiplied sixfold since 2012, and Brazil\u2019s holdings have stabilized after previous cuts, now at $223 billion. The article delves into the implications of these trends, emphasizing the shift in foreign ownership dynamics and the possible economic risks of an expanding national debt."

This downturn came after these tech giants had previously added $5 trillion in market cap by July 10. Nvidia, which had soared by 172% earlier in the year, saw a significant reduction of 12.6%, amounting to $418 billion, causing it to briefly exit the $3 trillion club. Meta also faced a substantial decline of 13.6% in the same period. Tesla's performance volatility led to discussions about its potential removal from the \"Magnificent 7.\" Despite these massive financial swings, there's a perception that trillion-dollar fluctuations are becoming less impactful in today's market landscape, especially when compared to the steady declines seen in Commercial Real Estate."

        "summary": "In the Wolf Street article \"Home Buyers Still on Strike Even as Mortgage Rates Drop to Lowest Since March,\" Wolf Richter explains that while mortgage rates have decreased to 6.87%, the lowest since mid-March, home buyers remain hesitant due to high home prices. This reluctance has led to a fall in applications for new home purchases, reaching their lowest levels since early June, indicating a continued buyers' strike. Despite this, refinancing activity has surged to its highest level since August 2022, as potential buyers wait for more affordable rates and home prices (\"Buyers' strike continues, prices are too high\"). Mortgage applications for purchasing homes have plummeted, showing a 47% decrease compared to 2019 and a 14% year-over-year decline, reflecting a low sales volume despite rising active listings and eager sellers reducing prices. Conversely, mortgage refinance applications, which collapsed in 2022 due to rising rates, are now trending upwards, with most current refinances being cash-out refinances, nearly doubling from November's low (\"Mortgage refi applications jump from collapsed levels\"). The Federal Reserve monitors these refinancing activities as they impact the pace of Quantitative Tightening (QT) related to its Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) holdings. An increase in refi activity leads to principals being repaid to MBS holders, hence reducing the Fed's MBS portfolio. Despite the recent uptick, refinance applications remain significantly lower than in previous years, showing a 66% drop from 2019 and an 81% drop from 2021, underscoring their inverse relationship with mortgage rates (\"As Fed watchers here\u2026\")."

This contributed to the Atlanta Federal Reserve raising its GDPNow forecast for Q2 GDP growth to 2.5% from 2.0% the previous week, with an estimate for real consumer spending growth increasing to 2.1% from 1.6%. Auto sales faced challenges in June due to a ransomware attack on CDK Global's cloud-based dealer management system, impacting 15,000 auto dealers, and despite delayed sales, prices of used vehicles fell significantly, effectively increasing real consumer spending. Total retail sales in June remained at $704 billion, with a 2.3% year-over-year increase despite the hack and price declines in various goods. Sales at the largest categories of retailers showed a mixed picture: new and used vehicle dealers and parts stores saw a 2% drop due to the CDK hack, ecommerce and nonstore retailers rose 1.9% month-over-month and 8.9% year-over-year, food services and drinking places increased 0.3% month-over-month and 4.4% year-over-year, and miscellaneous categories like cannabis stores increased slightly with variations in other sectors like gas stations and garden supply stores reflecting broader economic trends."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article explores Simon Property Group's strategic response to the challenges faced by brick-and-mortar retail. The company, the largest mall landlord in the U.S., has downsized its portfolio of shopping centers by 38% since 2012 in response to the sector's deteriorating conditions. Recently, Simon decided to relinquish the Philadelphia Mills outlet mall, Pennsylvania's second-largest mall, to lenders, reflecting a continued effort to offload underperforming properties. This mall's value has plummeted from $370 million in 2007 to $101 million, burdened further by an unpaid $259 million loan. Simon's actions are driven by accelerated store closures, declining cash flow due to the surge in online shopping, and lease expirations of major tenants like Burlington, AMC Theatres, and Marshalls, contributing to financial instability. To manage its exposure, Simon has engaged in various sales and spinoffs of mall properties, even buying bankrupt retailers to avoid vacancies in their malls. Since 2012, the company's number of shopping centers has reduced from 317 to 195 as of Q1 2024. This ongoing shift in consumer behavior towards record e-commerce sales has put additional strain on traditional mall operators like Simon.

        "summary": "The article on Wolf Street, written by Wolf Richter, delves into the dynamics of the short-term Treasury market and its repeatedly flawed predictions about rate cuts in light of prevailing inflation. In the section \"What the Short-Term Treasury Market Says about Rate Cuts, and How Repeatedly Wrong it Was so Far,\" the author points out that recent softer inflation reports have revived the possibility of a rate cut within the next six months, evidenced by a 10-basis point drop in the six-month Treasury yield after the latest CPI report. Despite this, shorter-term Treasury yields show no significant change, indicating no near-term rate cut expectations, particularly no cut foreseen in July but possible in September. In \"The market for the 2-year yield has been wrong all along,\" it is highlighted that the 2-year Treasury yield has continually misinterpreted the Federal Reserve's rate hike and cut decisions, initially predicting fewer and smaller rate hikes and later prematurely pricing in cuts. By April 2022, a 2.5% yield was promising amid historically low rates, yet this was much lower than the over 5% rates achieved by July 2023. Major financial analysts like Goldman Sachs also underestimated the terminal rate. The persistent misjudgment underscores that short-term T-bills would have been a better investment. As inflation remains unpredictable and persistent, future rate cuts may be further delayed, revealing the ongoing volatility and unforeseen outcomes in the market."

Despite the Bank of Canada implementing a rate cut at the beginning of the month, the market saw minimal impact on overall prices, which remained flat with a slight increase of 0.1% month-to-month. However, prices are down 14% from their 2022 peak and 3.4% year-over-year. Sales rose by 3.7% from May but were down 9.4% year-over-year, with new listings growing for the fifth time in six months and inventory up 26% year-over-year.

        "summary": "In the article \"Services PPI Inflation Dishes Up Another Nasty Surprise, 6th Month in a Row. Bottom of U-Turn was in December\" by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street, the latest data from the Services Producer Price Index (PPI) reveals a persistent inflationary trend, marking the sixth consecutive month of increases. Services, which constitute 62% of the total PPI, have experienced significant cost spikes, reminiscent of early 2021, with the PPI for services showing a notable 7.0% annualized increase in June over May. This trend suggests that inflationary pressures are deeply entrenched in the services sector, with the bottom of this inflation cycle observed in December, indicating a clear upward trajectory since then. While core goods prices remain stable and less volatile, the rising service costs are likely to be passed on to consumers, potentially reigniting consumer price inflation. Overall, core PPI and total PPI have both shown recent notable increases, reflecting a broader trend of rising service costs and suggesting persistent underlying inflationary trends as the economy moves towards late 2024."

        "summary": "The article \"Beneath the Skin of CPI Inflation: Historic Plunge in Durable Goods Prices, Plunge in Gasoline, and Outliers in Services\" by Wolf Richter discusses the significant components impacting the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation, focusing on June's data. The overall CPI saw a 3.0% year-over-year increase with a slight month-to-month dip of 0.06%. A historic decline in durable goods prices, particularly new and used vehicles, contributed to this trend, as the durable goods CPI dropped by 4.1% year-over-year, marking the largest decrease since 2003. The Core CPI, excluding food and energy, grew by 3.3% year-over-year. The Core services CPI increased by 5.0% year-over-year, slightly above 5% since December, while the Rent of Primary Residence CPI and the Owners\u2019 Equivalent of Rent CPI saw their smallest increases since 2021. Core CPI experienced its smallest month-to-month rise since January 2021, and durable goods CPI faced a substantial annualized decline of 5.9% in June. Despite these trends, certain services have shown unexpected price increases, becoming outliers in the Core services CPI data. The monthly increase in Core services CPI was 1.6%, creating the second consecutive outlier. The Rent of Primary Residence CPI rose by 3.2% annualized, and the Owners\u2019 Equivalent of Rent CPI increased by 3.4% annualized in June. Motor vehicle maintenance and repair inflation rose substantially but is decelerating. The Food away from Home CPI saw significant increases, with the fastest monthly rise since January, and the \"food at home\" CPI rose only 0.1% month-to-month and 1.1% year-over-year, indicating cooling trends after pandemic-induced spikes. Gasoline prices fell sharply by 3.8% month-to-month and 2.5% year-over-year, influenced by seasonal variations, while electricity, natural gas services, heating oil, and related fuels saw moderate price changes. The article provides a comprehensive overview of the various factors affecting CPI inflation, highlighting the volatility and complexity of these economic indicators."

In \"Home Buyers Remain on Strike, Housing Market Still Frozen as Prices Are Too High, Mortgage Rates Still 7%,\" Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell addressed Congress, highlighting that higher interest rates could ultimately make housing more affordable for younger individuals not yet in the market. Powell emphasized that while higher rates may be tough in the short term, they aim to achieve 2% inflation, creating a stronger economic foundation. The section \"Higher for Longer: 7% mortgages a year so far\" notes that the 30-year fixed mortgage rate has hovered between 6.75% and 7.9% since late 2022, contributing to limited consumer spending and reflecting the Fed's strategy to curb demand and inflation. Prospective buyers face tough refinancing decisions as renting remains comparatively cheaper. Historical context reveals that though 7% mortgage rates are not new, the current combination of high rates and inflated home prices evokes the strain of past housing bubbles. In \"With prices too high, buyers\u2019 strike continues,\" the article notes mortgage applications for home purchases are at historic lows, paralleling trends from late 2023 and significantly lower than 2021 and 2019 data. Inventory has grown with new listings, yet high prices deter buyers. Refinance applications remain reduced, primarily for cash-out purposes, showing a clear inverse relationship with mortgage rates."

        "summary": "Used car and truck prices continue to spiral downward in a historic plunge, surrendering 60% of the stunning two-year spike, a development thoroughly examined in Wolf Richter's article for Wolf Street. In June, the prices of used cars, SUVs, pickup trucks, and vans sold at US auctions fell by 0.6% from May and 8.9% year-over-year, dropping to $17,934, the lowest since March 2021. Non-seasonally adjusted, wholesale prices decreased by 2.2% from May and 10.0% year-over-year, based on Manheim's Used Vehicle Value Index. Despite an overall drop, prices for used electric vehicles (EVs) remain up by 61% from January 2020, while used internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles are up by 31%. A ransomware attack on CDK's cloud-based dealer management system possibly disrupted dealership inventory replenishments from auctions. During the pandemic, demand for Teslas surged, contributing to a 145% spike in used EV prices, which later normalized when Tesla reduced prices. Overall, used car and truck auction prices surged 65% from January 2020 to their May 2022 peak, later conceding 52% of the increase. Prices for used full-size light-duty pickups spiked 68% from January 2020 to May 2021 but have since dropped, retaining a 36% increase, while compact pickup prices surged 88%, still standing 66% higher than January 2020. Used SUV prices rose 63% from January 2020 to November 2021 and then fell, keeping a 26% increase from January 2020 levels. Van prices spiked by 70% by May 2022 and declined, also maintaining a 26% increase from January 2020. Compact car prices increased 56% by May 2022 but fell back, now up only 17% from January 2020. Compact cars are approaching pre-pandemic affordability levels, with recent models primarily foreign brands due to US automakers' exit from the ICE compact car market, driving their renewed affordability."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article titled \"Who Made or Lost What between Brookfield, Starwood, MetLife? An Office CRE Deal of the Low-Interest-Rate Era Gets Shredded in Foreclosure,\" authored by Wolf Richter, examines the complex financial outcomes for stakeholders in Manhattan and El Segundo's commercial real estate market during the low-interest-rate era. Brookfield Asset Management experienced substantial losses in Manhattan after defaulting on mortgage payments for an office building, acquired from a joint venture between Starwood Capital Group and MetLife, leading to foreclosure primarily due to high vacancy rates and rising interest rates. The article highlights the perils associated with high leverage in such an environment, as noted in sections \"An Office CRE Deal of the Low-Interest-Rate Era Gets Shredded in Foreclosure\" and \"Massive losses spreading across equity, debt, landlords, and lenders globally\". Further, the foreclosure of a 257,000 square-foot office building in El Segundo by MetLife Investment Management, after Starwood Capital and Artisan Ventures defaulted on their loan, underscores the broader distress in commercial real estate. MetLife's acquisition of the building at $72.8 million, substantially below the $132 million purchase price paid by Starwood and Artisan Ventures in 2020, illustrates the severe decline in property value, now 45% less since February 2020, and reflects MetLife's more conservative approach despite sustaining an $11.1 million loss. However, MetLife now faces a high vacancy rate in El Segundo. In \"Who lost or made what\", Brookfield made a substantial gain of $65 million, nearly doubling a prior investment by selling an office building in El Segundo, contrasting sharply with the significant losses suffered by Starwood and Artisan Ventures, who lost their equity following foreclosure. This situation underscores the inflated valuations and investment risks prevalent during the era of ultra-low interest rates."

        "summary": "The article \"Anatomy of an Office CRE Deal in Southern California, Made in the Low-Interest-Rate Era that Got Shredded in Foreclosure\" by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET dissects the fallout of a commercial real estate deal in Southern California involving Brookfield, Starwood, and MetLife. During an era of low interest rates, Brookfield purchased office properties at high prices, but as interest rates rose, property values plummeted, leading to defaults and foreclosures that inflicted substantial losses on involved parties, including Starwood and MetLife. In \"Widespread Losses Explained,\" the article focuses on how MetLife Investment Management foreclosed on a 12-story office building in El Segundo, originally bought by Starwood Capital and Artisan Ventures for $132 million in 2020 but valued at $72.8 million during foreclosure. Brookfield sold the property, initially bought for $67 million in 2017, for a $65 million profit in February 2020. Starwood Capital and Artisan Ventures lost $47 million as their equity was wiped out, while MetLife experienced an $11.1 million loss after acquiring the under-leased building. The overall scenario illustrates the risks of aggressive investment during low-interest periods. The article's section \"Who lost or made what\" highlights the extended fallout of these aggressive CRE investments."

The article explains that the QT process, aimed at managing inflationary pressures and reversing the pandemic-era Quantitative Easing (QE), includes a 41% reduction in Treasury securities and a 29% reduction in Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS). The \"Fed Balance Sheet QT\" section details these reductions, highlighting that the overall strategy began post-QE in April 2022, and June marks the first month of a slower QT pace. In the \"QT by category\" section, it mentions the Fed reduced Treasury holdings by $23 billion for a total of $1.33 trillion since June 2022, and MBS holdings by $19 billion, equal to a $404 billion total reduction from the peak. The \"Bank liquidity facilities\" section reports that the Discount Window's balance increased by $200 million to $6.4 billion, while the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) decreased by $1.6 billion to $106 billion after the Fed capped its expansion due to arbitrage opportunities. The Fed's QT measures aim to carefully manage liquidity in the economy without triggering issues like the 2019 repo market blowout."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter discusses discrepancies in the employment data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) driven by outdated population estimates from the Census Bureau, which failed to account for a significant wave of immigrants in 2022 and 2023. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) provided higher population growth estimates using Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data, leading to understated employment and labor force metrics in the Census Bureau\u2019s figures. The article suggests relying on the establishment survey, which shows job growth returning to normal pre-Covid levels, with payrolls increasing by 206,000 in June and a three-month average of 177,000 jobs. Additionally, wages saw a 3.5% annualized increase in June, with May revised up to a 5.3% annualized increase. The \"Longer-Term Trends of Employment by Industry Category\" section highlights sector-specific trends: construction employment hit an all-time high at 8.25 million, manufacturing plateaued at 12.95 million, and oil & gas saw modest gains at 121,000. Professional and business services employ 22.95 million but saw a slight decrease since May. The healthcare and social assistance sectors grew to 22.49 million, leisure and hospitality return to pre-pandemic levels at 16.91 million, and retail trade employs 15.67 million despite e-commerce pressures. Wholesale trade and financial activities hit new highs, transportation and warehousing showed steady increases, and the Information sector is growing post-layoffs. Government employment totals 23.36 million, with growth in local governments addressing teacher shortages."

Lennar Discloses the Numbers\". Lennar has disclosed significant costs, averaging $47,100 per house in the first half of 2024, which accounts for 10.1% of the average sales price. In Texas, these incentives rise to 16.9% or $51,600 per house, and in regions like Florida, they reach 13.4% or $81,700 per house. Despite a 5% decrease in average sales prices to $426,000, Lennar's revenues increased by 9% due to a 15% rise in home deliveries. However, D.R. Horton faced a substantial cost increase when its hedging strategies failed, resulting in a $65 million charge to the cost of goods sold. The article emphasizes that these costs are not reflected in the contract prices reported by the Census Bureau, as these prices are inflated by the incentives and mortgage-rate buydowns, which caused contract prices to drop by 4% during Lennar's Q2 compared to their peak in fall 2022."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter details fluctuations in new vehicle sales in Q2, emphasizing a year-over-year (YoY) surge in electric vehicle (EV) sales except for Tesla. Stellantis fell to the sixth position for the first time, trailing Honda. General Motors (GM) and Ford observed YoY declines in internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle sales while experiencing significant spikes in EV sales. Vehicle prices dropped due to increased incentives and discounts. Additionally, a ransomware attack on CDK Global\u2019s cloud-based dealership management system affected nearly 15,000 dealers, leading to manual sales processing and delayed reporting, particularly impacting Q2 data. Despite this, new vehicle sales for Q2 rose by 9.1% from Q1, totaling 4.08 million vehicles, down just 0.4% YoY. Average incentives per vehicle grew by 51%, and the average transaction price fell by 3% YoY to $44,857 in June. The industry faces a market glut, mainly in new vehicles, as post-pandemic price spikes diminish slowly due to an oversupply, pushing automakers and dealers to offer more discounts. In terms of the biggest automakers in Q2, GM saw a 0.6% rise in US sales with a 40% EV sales surge, Toyota\u2019s sales grew by 9.2% with a quadrupling of pure EV sales, and Ford\u2019s sales rose by 0.8%, with EV sales up 61%. Hyundai-Kia\u2019s combined sales increased slightly by 0.2%, with Hyundai and Kia seeing significant increases in EV sales. Honda\u2019s sales grew by 2.7% despite a cyberattack, while Stellantis saw a 21% drop due to an inventory glut. Nissan\u2019s sales fell by 3.1%, though its electric Ariya crossover sales surged 123%.

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter discusses the worsening state of commercial real estate (CRE) loans within the commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) market, highlighting surging delinquencies in the office, retail, and lodging sectors, suggesting that the market has yet to hit bottom. While industrial properties maintain strong financial health and multifamily properties manage to stay afloat amid broader economic difficulties, office CMBS delinquencies reached 7.6% in June, the highest since the 2016 oil bust, primarily driven by decreased office demand, floating-rate mortgages, and loan maturities with higher interest rates. The \"extend and pretend\" practice, where delinquent loans are renegotiated rather than foreclosed, has led landlords and lenders to prefer renegotiation to avoid taking inventory of depreciated properties, with significant losses for CMBS holders as major landlords, including Blackstone, abandon properties. The Retail CMBS delinquency rate for mall properties rose to 6.4% due to the ongoing \"Brick-and-Mortar Meltdown,\" with numerous retail chains filing for bankruptcy and major landlords walking away from malls. Despite challenges, the multifamily sector's CMBS delinquency rate rose modestly to 2.4% in June, remaining manageable as the sector is dominated by loans not securitized by private lenders, with the U.S. government responsible for a significant portion of these loans. Industrial CMBS delinquencies saw a slight increase to 0.6% in June but remain low, bolstered by infrastructure growth supporting ecommerce. Each section of the article\u2014\"It Gets Still Messier with CRE Loans, Bottom Not in Sight,\" \"So, yes, let\u2019s extend and pretend, please,\" \"Retail CMBS,\" and \"On the other hand...\"\u2014provides detailed insights into these conditions, underscoring the diverse impacts across different property types."

ECB President Christine Lagarde expresses concern over rising labor costs, which are contributing to persistent inflation in the services sector. In the \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET\" section, it is detailed that services inflation rose by 4.1% year-over-year in the 20 euro-using countries, the highest since October, suggesting that the 4%-plus range for services inflation is becoming established. Energy prices have significantly dropped from 2022 peaks but remain high, while durable goods prices fell and food prices increased at a lower rate. Core CPI, excluding volatile elements, increased by 2.9% in June, driven by stable services inflation, even as goods prices stabilized. Despite the ECB cutting its policy rate to 4.25% amid economic slowdown and inflation moderation, persistent services inflation and slow declines in goods prices could push core CPI above the ECB's 2% target. Christine Lagarde emphasized wage growth as a key factor behind services inflation, with substantial year-over-year increases in various Euro Area countries, and forward-looking wage growth measures indicating sustained high rates, suggesting services inflation may not ease soon."

Initially seen as a strategic expansion of its streaming and video rental operations, the acquisition failed to produce the expected benefits, underscoring the risks involved in buying companies from private equity firms, a phenomenon described as \"Consensual Hallucination.\" Authored by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street, the report highlights CSSE\u2019s financial decline, exacerbated by its purchase of Redbox while saddled with debt. Despite being one of the first Regulation A+ IPOs under the 2012 JOBS Act and raising up to $50 million from small investors, the company consistently lost money annually, topping $636 million in 2023. Additional acquisitions, including streaming service Crackle and website A Plus, further strained finances. By June of that year, CSSE had depleted its cash reserves, missed payroll, and reported debts totaling $970 million against $414 million in assets. CEO William J. Rouhana, Jr. dismissed the board before stepping down, with Bart Schwartz taking over as CEO. The company is now seeking a debtor-in-possession loan to sustain operations during bankruptcy proceedings, or it may face liquidation. Once popular among speculative traders, CSSE's shares have now plunged to near worthlessness."

Central banks are diversifying their assets into other currencies and gold, with the USD's share increasing slightly to 58.9% in Q1 2023, up from a low of 58.4% in Q4 2022. Despite the decline, central banks held $6.77 trillion in USD-denominated assets out of $12.3 trillion in total foreign exchange reserves. The article outlines \"The other major reserve currencies,\" noting that the euro maintains a stable 19.7% share, while smaller increases are seen in \"nontraditional reserve currencies\" like the Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, and Swiss franc. However, the Chinese RMB has declined to its lowest level since Q2 2020. \"The rise of the 'nontraditional reserve currencies'\" is attributed to the search for higher yields and liquidity in various markets.

It reports that for the 17th consecutive month, incomes have outpaced inflation, giving households more capacity to spend and save. In the section \"Our Drunken Sailors Leaving the Party? Nah, Not Yet,\" it is highlighted that consumer spending in May increased significantly due to higher incomes, with disposable incomes, adjusted for inflation, rising by 0.5% from April. This continued trend indicates no immediate economic slowdown. The subsequent section discusses that income sources, excluding transfer receipts, grew by 0.5% month-over-month and 2% year-over-year, driven by employment growth and higher earnings from various sources. Transfer receipts also saw a modest increase, primarily due to rising Social Security benefits. The personal saving rate climbed to 3.9%, reflecting cautious but active financial behavior among consumers. In \"How our Drunken Sailors disposed of their disposable income,\" the article notes that consumer spending, adjusted for inflation, increased by 0.3% in May and 2.4% from the previous year, reflecting steady growth. Spending on services, despite inflation, grew, covering essentials such as rents and healthcare. Nondurable goods spending rose by 0.3% for the month and 1.6% year-over-year, while durable goods spending increased by 1.1% for the month, indicating sustained purchases of durable items. This comprehensive analysis suggests that income growth and consumer spending remain robust, with no immediate signs of economic decline."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter, \"Fed\u2019s Wait-and-See on Rate Cuts Makes Sense amid Whiplash Data,\" examines the Federal Reserve's cautious approach to interest rate cuts amid conflicting economic signals. The article notes that while the core PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) inflation rate over the past six months is the highest since mid-2023, pointing to ongoing inflationary pressures, there are unusual fluctuations such as a significant drop in durable goods orders. The May data reveal the \"core\" PCE price index rose just 1.0% annualized month-over-month, primarily due to a sharp decline in the durable goods index (-9.1% annualized) and a modest increase in the core services index (+2.1% annualized). The six-month annualized core PCE price index rose by 3.2%, the worst increase since July last year. In \"In summary, year-over-year,\" it\u2019s highlighted that the overall PCE price index remained unchanged from April to May but rose by 2.6% year-over-year, while the core PCE price index also increased by 2.6% year-over-year, staying above the Fed's 2% target. The durable goods PCE price index saw a 3.2% year-over-year drop, the largest since 2004. The core services PCE price index increased by 2.1% annualized from April to May, marking the smallest increase since August 2023. However, significant consumer expenses in the core services sector such as housing, healthcare, and transportation services continue to experience entrenched inflation, with the housing PCE price index accelerating to 5.2% annualized in May. Other core services categories exhibited volatility; for example, financial services and insurance showed a 5.4% year-over-year increase but a -3.9% month-over-month decline, and the healthcare PCE price index rose 3.1% year-over-year with an 8.8% month-to-month annualized increase. This complex economic environment underlines the Fed's cautious stance on rate cuts."

        "summary": "The article from Wolf Street, written by Wolf Richter, examines the current housing market dynamics characterized by a significant decline in home demand and a rise in inventory levels. The National Association of Realtors (NAR), referencing their pending home sales data, indicates that the index value dropped by 2.1% from April and 6.8% year-over-year in May, bringing it close to the record low set in April 2020. This index, standing at 70.8 compared to an average of 100 in 2001, represents a 29% decrease, with sharp declines when compared to recent years. Despite increasing inventory levels that hit 3.7 months in May (the highest since June 2020) and a significant 18.5% year-over-year jump to 1.28 million homes, demand has noticeably plummeted. The NAR describes the situation as an \"interesting point\" where rising availability contrasts with dropping buyer interest, leading to expectations of \"stabilizing home prices\" in the latter half of 2024. Although NAR anticipates a decrease in mortgage rates could boost home buying activity, they project that mortgage rates will remain above 6% through 2024 and 2025, even with potential Federal Reserve rate cuts."

        "summary": "The article from Wolf Street, written by Wolf Richter, discusses the dramatic devaluation of the Japanese yen, which has fallen to 161 against the US dollar, a decline of 34% since 2020 and 53% since 2012, raising concerns of a potential currency collapse. The section \"Yen Drops to 161 against USD\" explains how Japan's prolonged trade deficits and weak yen exacerbate energy price shocks, prompting the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to reconsider its aggressive monetary policies. In \"Jawboning and costly interventions were useless,\" the article details how Japanese authorities spent $62 billion in foreign exchange interventions to support the yen, which had only temporary effects as the yen dropped past the \u00a5160 level. Despite \"serious concerns\" expressed by currency chief Masato Kanda and statements from Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki, no direct actions were implemented. The section \"A collapsed yen is not good for Japan\" highlights the detrimental impact of a weak yen, such as high import costs and strained economic conditions, despite benefiting Japanese global companies on paper. Inflation and rising service costs are also affecting domestic profit margins, although increased tourism is a positive outcome. Lastly, \"The BOJ\u2019s painfully too-little-too-late\" discusses how the BOJ was slow to respond as other central banks raised rates and tapered QE while maintaining negative rates and yield-curve control, only starting to reverse its policy by 2024. The BOJ's minor rate hikes and ending some QE measures were insufficient, planning more significant steps like further rate hikes and QT in contrast to countries like Mexico and Brazil, which safeguarded their currencies with early and substantial rate hikes."

        "summary": "In the June 2024 update of \"The Most Splendid Housing Bubbles in America\" by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street, the article states that housing markets in cities such as San Francisco, Seattle, Phoenix, Portland, Denver, Dallas, and Las Vegas are still below their peak prices from 2022. Meanwhile, Boston, New York, Miami, Los Angeles, San Diego, Washington DC, and Chicago have achieved new highs. The previously intense rate-cut enthusiasm has waned, leading to a noticeable deceleration in housing price growth. The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index, covering prices from February through April, highlights the residual effects of the Rate-Cut Mania that started in November and peaked in February. By April, the 20-City Index showed a 1.4% month-to-month rise in home prices, slightly down from the previous month's 1.6%. Year-over-year, the index increased by 7.2%, down from 7.5% in March and 7.4% in February. All 20 metro areas saw price increases, with monthly rises from 0.1% for New York condos to 2.2% for Boston single-family homes. Compared to the June 2022 high, the index was up 3.5%, though prices in seven metro areas remained below their 2022 peaks. The section \"The Most Splendid Housing Bubbles by Metro\" delves into home-price changes across key metro areas like San Francisco, Seattle, and Phoenix. Notably, since 2000, San Diego led home-price inflation at 343%, followed by Miami and Los Angeles, against an 86% rise in the consumer price index for the same period. The Case-Shiller Index measures home-price inflation using the \"sales pairs\" method, comparing current and previous sale prices adjusted for improvements. Despite recent spikes post-2020 Fed policies, six metros, including Chicago, didn't qualify for the most splendid housing bubbles list due to relatively lower overall home-price inflation. Chicago\u2019s home prices rose 105% since 2000."

        "summary": "A recent article by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street discusses a surprise surge in Canada's core CPI, which marked the highest month-to-month increase since 2022, presenting complications for the Bank of Canada (BoC) as it aims for economic stability. In June, the BoC had reduced policy rates by 25 basis points due to cooled inflation trends but had warned that future cuts depended on inflation continuing to ease towards a 2% target. In May, the Core CPI excluding food and energy spiked by 4.9% month-to-month annualized, maintaining a year-over-year increase of 2.9% for the fourth consecutive month. The BoC\u2019s preferred measures of underlying inflation, referred to as CPI trim and CPI median, showed sharp re-acceleration with both measures increasing by 4.1% on an annualized basis and nearing 3% year-over-year. National Bank of Canada analysts were surprised, noting that inflation had not been fully tamed, echoing warnings from central banks about persistent inflation pressures. Overall CPI rose to 3.8% annualized, holding at 2.9% year-over-year for the fifth month. In the housing sector, the CPI for shelter, which includes rents and homeownership costs, surged 4.7% annualized and 6.4% year-over-year, staying high for the fourth month. Other sectors like transportation, food, and healthcare saw year-over-year increases, while household operations and clothing experienced declines."

        "summary": "In Q1 2024, the US car and truck bestseller rankings experienced significant shifts, detailed in an article by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street. The Ford F-150, traditionally a top seller, dropped to fourth place with a decreasing market share despite an increase in EV truck sales. The Toyota RAV4 surged to the #1 bestseller position due to replenished inventories, while the Tesla Model Y remained second with a slight increase in market share. The Honda CR-V climbed to third place, and the Chevy Silverado fell to sixth. These changes highlight significant dynamics in the automotive marketplace, with Ford's reliance on F-150 trucks facing challenges as sales of its internal combustion engine models declined even though overall new vehicle sales increased. In the \"Share by automaker\" section, the rankings of new vehicle registrations remained mostly consistent, with General Motors leading at 15.7%, followed closely by Toyota at 15.6%, and Ford at 13.0%. Subaru moved up to ninth place while Tesla dropped to tenth. Stellantis was in fourth at 9.0%, Honda in fifth at 8.8%, and Nissan in sixth at 7.3%. Electric vehicle sales maintained a 7.9% share of total registrations, with the national fleet of EVs growing to 3.6 million out of 289.6 million light-duty vehicles."

Publicly held dealers like AutoNation, Group 1 Automotive, Lithia Motors, Sonic Automotive, and Penske Automotive Group reported varying disruption levels, and even CarMax experienced minor issues due to dependencies on other dealers\u2019 systems. The incident could impact Q2 economic data by delaying vehicle deliveries and affecting consumer spending metrics. CDK has been relatively opaque about the hack specifics, recently confirming it as a ransomware attack with multi-million dollar ransom demands, but it remains uncertain if customer data was compromised."

Foreign investors, including those from Japan, China, and European countries, hold $8 trillion of this debt. US mutual funds, individuals, banks, state and local governments, and other domestic entities collectively own significant portions, as outlined in the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) Quarterly Fixed Income Report. This distribution indicates a continuous demand for Treasury securities, although concerns arise about rising interest payments and the possibility that future yields might need to increase to attract new investors."

        "summary": "In a recent Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter titled \"Home Sales Sag Further, Hit by Mortgage Rates. Price Cuts & Active Listings Surge. Median Price Skewed by Surge in High-End Sales,\" home sales have continued to decline, significantly impacted by high mortgage rates around 7%. Particularly, the mid- and lower-priced segments are experiencing a sharp drop as potential buyers hold off, anticipating lower rates in the future. Concurrently, price reductions and the number of active listings are increasing. Despite overall declines, there has been a surge in high-end sales, which has skewed the median price upward. The sales rate of existing homes in May dropped to 4.11 million, slightly above the lowest levels since the 2010 housing bust. The decrease in market activity and inventory levels is due to homeowners with 3% mortgage rates choosing to stay put. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has fluctuated between 6.5% and 7.5% since late 2022. Price reductions have affected 35% of active listings, with supply levels growing to 3.7 months and active listings reaching 788,000 homes. The average days on the market was 44, the highest for any May since 2020. Sales data from the National Association of Realtors (NAR) show marked increases in higher-end home sales, which have skewed the median home price upward to reach record highs of $424,500 for single-family homes and $371,300 for condos and co-ops."

China's steel production suffered its worst three-year drop ever, decreasing by 4.3% to 1,019 million tonnes in 2023 due to a property crisis and manufacturing slowdown. This marks a stark contrast to years of booming growth. Despite this decline, global crude steel production slightly rose to 1,892 million tonnes in 2023. The \"China v. the Rest of the World\" section reveals China's declining yet still dominant share of global steel production at 53.9%, while North America's share dipped to 5.8%. The top steel-producing countries include China, producing 1,019 million tonnes, followed by India at 141 million tonnes, with the US trailing well behind. Global steel company rankings see Nucor advancing to the 15th position globally, while US Steel, ranked 24th, faces acquisition by Nippon Steel, the fourth largest. China holds eleven of the top twenty company slots. Overall, the article illustrates a shifting landscape in global steel production, significantly impacted by China's economic challenges."

        "summary": "Foreign holders of U.S. debt, particularly from the Euro Area, Canada, and other financial centers, have been increasing their holdings significantly. This comes as China reduces its U.S. Treasury securities, leading to a shift in the distribution of U.S. debt holdings. Despite this increased appetite from other regions, the overall foreign purchases are not keeping pace with the rapidly growing U.S. debt. By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET, the article explores foreign investors' continued support for US Treasury debt, now nearing $35 trillion, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding demand. Despite the ballooning debt, appetite for Treasury securities remains high, as indicated by the 10-year yield standing at 4.2%, which is below the expected rate of over 5%, considering the current inflation rate at 3.4% and short-term yields at 5.5%. The share of foreign holdings has seen foreign investors steadily increasing their Treasury securities holdings, but the rapid growth of U.S. debt has reduced their share of total debt from over 33% in 2014-2016 to 22.9% now. Consequently, U.S. debt financing has become less reliant on foreign holders, including China and Japan. In March, foreign-held Treasury debt peaked at an all-time high and slightly dipped in April to $7.92 trillion, representing a 6.3% year-over-year increase. China and Hong Kong v. the Euro Area explains how China and Hong Kong have reduced their combined holdings of US Treasury securities from over $1.4 trillion in 2012-2017 to $992 billion currently, while the Euro Area's holdings surged from $500 billion in 2011 to $1.58 trillion now, marking an over $1 trillion increase and a year-over-year rise of 14.6%. Six major financial centers\u2014the UK, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Cayman Islands, and Ireland\u2014have collectively increased their holdings to $2.31 trillion, up 9.2% year-over-year, with details including the UK at $710 billion, Luxembourg at $384 billion, and the Cayman Islands at $319 billion. Japan's Treasury securities holdings have increased by 2.2% year-over-year, reaching $1.15 trillion. Other top foreign holders of Treasury securities include Canada, which holds $338 billion in US Treasury securities, marking a 36.9% increase year-over-year; Taiwan at $257 billion, a 5.3% increase year-over-year; India with $234 billion, showing a yearly decline of 2.2%; Brazil with $224 billion and a 2.7% decrease year-over-year; and France, part of the Euro Area, surging to a record high of $277 billion, outpacing Germany, which holds $87 billion."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article, \"The Collapse of the EV SPACs: Fisker Joins the Bankruptcy Party, Others on the Verge\" by Wolf Richter, discusses the financial downfall of electric vehicle (EV) companies that went public via special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) during a period of easy monetary policy. Fisker, which went public through a SPAC in October 2020, filed for bankruptcy after burning through over $1 billion in investor funds. This trend reflects a broader pattern of EV SPAC bankruptcies, marked by the sector's inability to transform initial enthusiasm and high valuations into sustainable businesses. Fisker, led by CEO Henrik Fisker, failed to reach mass production and faced quality issues with its Ocean SUV, culminating in production halts, inventory problems, delisting from the NYSE, and eventual bankruptcy. Other companies that followed this path include Electric Last Mile Solutions, which went bankrupt within a year of its SPAC merger, Proterra, which declared bankruptcy in April 2023, and Lordstown Motors, which filed for bankruptcy after misleading investors about additional funding. The section \"EV SPACS that are no longer twitching\" illustrates these cases. Meanwhile, the section \"EV SPACs that are still twitching\" highlights companies on the brink of collapse, such as VinFast Auto, Nikola, Canoo, Lucid Motors, Faraday Future, Lion Electric, Polestar, and Rivian; all of which have seen significant declines in their stock prices and face substantial financial challenges despite initial market optimism."

        "summary": "In a Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter, it is highlighted that consumer spending has surged in the retail and vehicle sectors, but prices have fallen from pandemic highs, normalizing the overall cost of goods. This trend suggests continued substantial purchasing by consumers, positively impacting inflation-adjusted consumer spending and GDP. Retail sales are influenced by seasonal adjustments and inflation/deflation, with May seeing significant unit sales growth in vehicles and other items, though dollar sales increases were more modest due to lower prices. Durable goods like vehicles, electronics, and furniture experienced price drops, benefiting consumers but presenting challenges for retailers. Similarly, nondurable goods such as gasoline and apparel saw price decreases, which lowered dollar sales for retailers. Examining retail sales by major segment, new and used vehicle sales showed significant unit increases despite price drops, ecommerce maintained consistent growth, and bars and restaurants had mixed results with seasonal highs. Gas stations' sales mirrored gasoline prices, building materials dropped from pandemic peaks, and segments like clothing and general merchandise showed moderate growth, while furniture and home furnishings declined due to a shift towards ecommerce. Department stores continued to shrink, and sporting goods and electronics had mixed results, reflecting broader retail trends. Overall, lower prices in consumer goods play a significant role in economic metrics and retail sales dynamics."

        "summary": "In the Wolf Street article \"Hot Wage Growth Bedevils Wishlist for ECB Rate Cuts,\" Wolf Richter discusses the recent surge in wages across the Euro Area, which has risen by 5.3%, matching a previous record increase. This significant wage growth complicates the European Central Bank's (ECB) strategy for potential rate cuts, as the ECB identifies it as a substantial risk to inflation targets. IG Metall, Germany's largest labor union, is advocating for a 7% wage hike over 12 months to offset inflation, reflecting similar trends throughout the Euro Area. For instance, notable year-over-year wage increases in Q1 include 6.3% in Germany, 7.6% in the Netherlands, and 9.8% in Austria. This data emerged shortly after the ECB's rate cut, underscoring wage increases as a critical component in inflation expectations. Additionally, the ECB's measure of \"negotiated wages,\" linked to collective bargaining agreements, recorded a 4.7% year-over-year rise in Q1, covering approximately two-thirds of the Euro Area economy. While rising wages support households by enhancing spending and economic growth, they also perpetuate inflation by elevating demand and labor costs. Despite the ECB's efforts to control inflation, the Euro Area's core CPI has recently risen to 2.9%, exceeding the 2% target and signaling persistent inflationary pressures."

The broader market, as represented by the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index, has struggled in comparison to these large-cap giants. While the Russell 2000 has fallen to levels last seen in January 2021 and is down 1% year-to-date in 2024, the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index has dropped to January 2022 levels. The Russell 2000 declined 1.6% on Friday and is down 18% from its peak in November 2021. In stark contrast, the Nasdaq Composite achieved its fifth consecutive record close, up 9.1% from its previous high and 73% from a trough in December 2022, driven significantly by a handful of large-cap stocks. The S&P 500 is heavily influenced by six massive stocks, which contribute $15.2 trillion of its $45 trillion market cap, raising concerns about the lack of diversification. Year-to-date in 2024, larger indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are up significantly, revealing a fragmented market. Notably, Tesla has fallen from the group of top seven technology stocks with a notable market cap drop, but the remaining six continue to drive substantial market movements.

        "summary": "The article \"Rate-Cut Mania\u2019s 20.7% Spike in French Stock Market Comes Home to Roost\" by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET examines the significant volatility experienced by the French stock market, particularly the CAC 40 index. This volatility stemmed from a 20.7% spike driven by speculation around rate cuts and monetary easing. However, this gain reversed sharply due to unfulfilled expectations, underscoring the risks tied to speculative investments and the necessity of sound economic fundamentals. Despite a recent 8.9% drop from its all-time high on May 15, influenced by political uncertainty and fears of a far-right election win, these declines were relatively modest when compared to the preceding surge. The article points out that the correction only reverted the CAC 40 back to its April 2023 levels, preserving most of the year's gains. It also highlights how media alarmism exaggerated the market downturn, contrasting with the actual long-term impact, suggesting that the media's portrayal amplified perceptions rather than reflecting substantial market dynamics."

        "summary": "Total liabilities on the Federal Reserve's balance sheet have dropped by $1.71 trillion as a result of Quantitative Tightening (QT), reaching $7.22 trillion, the lowest since December 2020. The reduction in liabilities corresponds to the decline in assets following the end of Quantitative Easing (QE) in April 2022. The five key liabilities include reserves, Other Federal Reserve Assets (ON RRPs), currency in circulation, the Treasury General Account (TGA), and reverse repurchase agreements (RRPs) with foreign official counterparties. Reserves have decreased by $265 billion during QT, currently at $3.46 trillion. ON RRPs saw a significant $1.92 trillion decrease from their peak, now at $448 billion. Meanwhile, Currency in Circulation stands at $2.35 trillion, the TGA at $650 billion, and RRPs with foreign officials at $385 billion, with specific functions independent of QE or QT decisions. Wolf underscores the importance of monitoring reserves to avoid potential banking system complications and aims for a sufficient level rather than the current surplus."

        "summary": "In a recent report on Wolf Street, Wolf Richter discusses a notable anomaly in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for May, driven by a sharp decrease in services that impacted Core CPI and overall CPI measures. The month-to-month core CPI saw a minimal increase due to an outlier in core services, leading to the smallest rise since August 2021. Year-over-year CPI measures showed mixed trends, with Core services CPI increasing by 5.2%, Durable goods CPI falling by 3.8%, Core CPI going up by 3.4%, and Overall CPI increasing by 3.3%. Housing components of core services CPI, services related to motor vehicles, durable goods CPI, food inflation, and energy prices were all detailed in the analysis. These factors together underscore the broader impact of the anomaly within services on the overall inflation data for May 2024."

The Fed reiterated its stance on adjusting rates only when confident about inflation reaching 2%, pushing back against rate cut speculations. The FOMC's statement pointed out a more balanced labor market, with a notable shift in the 'dot plot' projection indicating just one rate cut in 2024, a departure from previous expectations. GDP growth and inflation estimates were revised upward while the unemployment rate projection held steady. Additionally, the Fed is continuing with its asset reduction at a slower pace to prevent disruptions in the market."

        "summary": "In an article by Wolf Street, Wolf Richter reports on Fitch Ratings' outlook on the office commercial real estate (CRE) market, which contrasts with some fund managers' optimism. Fitch anticipates further deterioration in office loan performance through 2024 due to higher interest rates, slower economic growth, a tighter lending environment, and a decline in office demand. With significant vacancy levels in major office markets, around 30%, refinancing challenges are mounting, possibly leading to increased loan delinquencies. Fitch raised its forecast for office delinquencies to surpass levels seen during the Financial Crisis by the end of 2024. Additionally, the $1.2 billion in CMBS office loans that became delinquent in May, offset by $2 billion resolving delinquent office loans, caused fluctuations in the Office CMBS delinquency rate, which dropped to 6.94%. Had the $2 billion remained delinquent, the rate would have been higher at 8.48%."

Prices for compact cars, SUVs, and vans also experienced significant fluctuations. Additionally, there has been a 44% rise in auto insurance costs due to the spike in used vehicle prices. The auctions play a vital role in facilitating dealers' vehicle inventory restocking. Wolf Richter delves into the impact of the pandemic-induced spike unwinding, noting the continued elevated prices in certain vehicle categories. Overall, the used vehicle market remains dynamic, with potential implications for associated industries such as insurance."

        "summary": "The Federal Reserve's balance sheet decreased by $107 billion in May, reaching $7.26 trillion, the lowest since December 2020. Overall, $1.71 trillion has been shed since the end of quantitative easing in April 2022, removing 40% of Treasury securities and 28% of Mortgage-Backed Securities added during the pandemic. The Fed aims to gradually reduce its balance sheet without causing disruptions, moving away from the pace set in May to a new schedule starting in June. Wolf explains that the Fed's balance sheet increase before 2008 was tied to the rising currency in circulation, which has quadrupled from $600 billion in 2003 to $2.35 trillion today. The increase in total assets from $720 billion in 2003 to $910 billion in August 2008 closely followed this. The red line on the graph reflects the Fed's varied assets, including overnight repos and a growing base of Treasury securities.  \nAmid the Financial Crisis, the Fed's balance sheet further expanded due to the government transferring its checking accounts to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for security. This move added $703 billion to the balance sheet in 2009, marking it as a liability. The inclusion of this, along with the currency in circulation and other liabilities like reserves and ON RRPs, totals over $3 trillion. The Fed reduced its Treasury securities holdings by $57 billion in May, reaching $4.46 trillion, the lowest since September 2020. Since the pandemic, the Fed has shed 40% of the $3.27 trillion in Treasury securities added through QE. The monthly roll-off cap will decrease to $25 billion starting in June, excluding inflation protection from TIPS. In May, the Fed lowered its MBS holdings by $17 billion, totaling $2.35 trillion, the lowest since July 2021. The reduction in MBS holdings has reached 28% of the amount added during pandemic QE. Due to decreased mortgage payments from slowed sales and refinancing, MBS removal from the balance sheet is below the $35-billion cap, which has now been effectively removed under the new QT policy. Bank liquidity facilities discussed in the article include the Discount Window, with outstanding loans dropping from $153 billion to $6.2 billion in May, and the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), which decreased from $168 billion to $108 billion and is on track to reach zero by March 11, 2025. The Discount Window offers loans at 5.5% interest but with a stigma attached, leading banks to use it sparingly. The BTFP faced challenges due to an arbitrage opportunity that spiked its balances, prompting the Fed to adjust rates and eventually end the program, aligning with the broader reduction of bank-panic facilities to zero. In May, assets dropped by $108 billion despite the $95 billion cap on Quantitative Tightening (QT). Treasury securities took a big hit with a $57 billion decline, while MBS dropped by $17 billion. Additionally, BTFP assets fell by $16 billion, Unamortized Premiums and Discounts by $4 billion, and other assets by $10 billion. The Discount Window along with remnants of 2020-era SPVs accounted for a $1 billion decrease."

        "summary": "In his article on Wolf Street, Wolf Richter criticizes the Bank of Japan (BoJ) for ending quantitative easing (QE) too late, given Japan's trade deficits and a weakened yen. The BoJ's JGB holdings showed fluctuations, with equity ETF and Japanese REIT purchases halted, corporate bonds decreasing, and loans peaking in March before dropping in May. Despite a steady asset level, the BoJ has faced pressure as the yen depreciated against the dollar due to Federal Reserve policy changes. Rising inflation for Japanese businesses, particularly in services, gives the BoJ impetus for potential rate hikes. Wolf highlights the negative impact of a weak yen on Japan due to trade deficits since 2010, leading to increased import costs, higher energy prices, and challenges for major manufacturers' offshoring strategies. Criticizing the BoJ's slow response, Wolf argues for substantial quantitative tightening and rate hikes to stabilize the yen, citing the bank's miscalculations and emphasizing the need for decisive action rather than incremental changes."

This boom is seen across industries like semiconductors, with massive investments following the CHIPS Act, and beyond, including the auto industry and other sectors. While inflation plays a role in construction costs, it is just a small factor fueling this trend, reflecting a larger corporate strategy shift amid supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions. Construction costs are only a part of the total investment in a factory, with semiconductor plants requiring substantial funds for equipment and operation. Companies like Intel and TSMC are making multi-billion-dollar investments in fab facilities, contributing to the overall construction surge. Additionally, new factories are emerging beyond semiconductors, such as Toyota's commitment to an electric SUV facility in Indiana, signaling a broader expansion in manufacturing endeavors across different states."

        "summary": "Wolf Street's article, written by Wolf Richter, delves into the escalating issue of interest payments on the US government's ballooning debt, which have surged in Q1 2024 to $264 billion, reflecting a 21% increase. Despite solid tax receipts of $775 billion, interest payments now exceed corporate tax revenue and surpass half of individual income taxes collected. The ratio of interest payments to tax receipts stood at 34.1% in Q1, down from a peak of 36.1% in Q3, signaling potential strain on national income. Interest payments, amounting to 3.8% of GDP, have reached levels not seen since 1998, posing concerns about the substantial portion of the economic output allocated to covering these expenses. Wolf suggests that higher yields may attract investors to purchase government debt, alleviating demand challenges but potentially leading to increased interest payments and inflation. This inflationary trend could serve as both a consequence and a long-term solution, benefiting governments by boosting tax revenue and devaluing existing debts."

UiPath's $1.6 billion losses over five years, a $49 million loss in Q1 2024, increased deal scrutiny, and lengthening sales cycles also contributed to its stock plunge. Salesforce faced a 19.7% drop in shares, missing revenue estimates and issuing disappointing guidance, mainly attributed to AI spending affecting other areas. Several other software companies experienced similar stock markdowns, echoing the impact of AI spending."

        "summary": "In a recent article by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET, it was highlighted that Nonresidential commercial real estate (CRE) loans are causing concern for certain banks due to their higher exposure to these loans. Despite banks reporting $64 billion in net income in Q1, they are starting to face significant credit losses, with 63 banks listed on the FDIC's \"Problem Bank List\" with total assets of $82 billion. Noncurrent loans have risen to 0.91% of total loans, driven mainly by CRE loans, particularly in office portfolios. Nonresidential nonfarm CRE loans have notably high nonaccrual rates compared to other categories. Delinquency rates are a concern, especially for large banks with over $250 billion in assets, where the nonresidential CRE loan rate spiked to 4.48%. However, these troubled nonfarm nonresidential CRE loans only make up 9.4% of banks' total loan portfolios, remaining relatively low and providing some stability as the industry navigates through changes."

        "summary": "Wolf Richter discusses the status of US banks' unrealized losses in Q1 2024, noting a brief reprieve during the rate-cut mania that has since ended. Commercial banks witnessed a $39 billion increase in unrealized losses on securities, reaching $517 billion, with $305 billion attributed to Held to Maturity (HTM) and $211 billion to Available for Sale (AFS) securities. The $5.47 trillion in securities held by banks reflects a shift in investments towards longer-term securities with positive yields, resulting in significant losses as interest rates rose. Interest rate risk is magnified by longer maturities, with 30-year Treasury securities showing the highest market value losses. This trend underscores the vulnerability of banks in a volatile market, as economic uncertainty continues to pose challenges."

        "file_location": "./data/Bank of England to Sell All Remaining Bonds and Use Repos Instead to Manage Liquidity & Financial Stability.md",
        "summary": "Wolf Richter discusses Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey's outline of the BOE's plan to revert to pre-Financial Crisis liquidity handling methods using repos instead of QE. The BOE aims to drain reserves and utilize repos for liquidity management, a shift from long-term bonds to short-term repos. This move echoes traditional central bank practices and signals a departure from the QE era. The Fed, having revived its Standing Repo Facility in 2021, is also preparing to use repos more prominently, learning from past liquidity issues during quantitative tightening. Wolf explains that during quantitative easing, the BOE lent funds to the Asset Purchase Facility, its off-balance-sheet entity, which then bought bonds. As quantitative tightening reduces assets in the AFP, loans are repaid to the BOE, decreasing the balance sheet. The BOE purchased bonds in waves during crises like the financial crisis, Euro Debt Crisis, Brexit, and the pandemic, with holdings nearly doubling to \u00a3895 billion during the pandemic. The BOE is unique in actively selling bonds under QT, with the APF declining by \u00a3194 billion, or 22%, from its peak, including shedding all its corporate bonds and 44% of pandemic bond purchases. Wolf explains that the Bank of England sold bonds outright to reduce its holdings. By February 2022, the BOE held about 55 gilt issues with varying maturities, stretching out to 2071. To expedite this, the bank began selling portions of each issue regularly. For example, one issue set to mature in 2039 has already been completely sold. Others, like the 2071 and 2068 maturities, have been significantly reduced from their peak levels. The article discusses the drawdown of reserves by quantitative tightening (QT) and the importance of maintaining a balance to prevent a liquidity shortage in the financial system. Governor Bailey highlights the historical use of lower reserves pre-crisis but stresses the necessity of adequate reserves for financial stability. The concept of a \"Preferred Minimum Range of Reserves\" (PMRR) is introduced, aiming to estimate the minimum level of reserves needed for banks' transactions and liquidity management. Currently, reserves stand at \u00a3760 billion, with the PMRR estimated between \u00a3345 billion to \u00a3490 billion, suggesting a potential further drop in the balance sheet by \u00a3270 billion to \u00a3415 billion. The timeline for reaching this range could be by the second half of 2025 due to the ongoing QT and unwinding of the TFSME. Wolf explains that as the level of reserves demanded by banks approaches minimum levels, temporary frictions may occur in money markets. To address these challenges, the Bank of England introduced a Short-Term Repo facility in 2022, alongside other reserve supply operations like the Indexed Long-Term Repo. The Short-Term Repo allows banks to borrow unlimited reserves against gilt collateral at Bank Rate. This combination of facilities aims to manage the unwind of QE and the TFSME smoothly without sacrificing monetary control on the path to the Potential Minimum Reserve Requirement Ratio (PMRR). The Bank of England official discussed how the process of quantitative tightening (QT) will evolve once the balance sheet stabilizes. \"QT enters a new phase\" as the gilts in the APF could drop below the Prudential Minimum Requirement Ratio (PMRR), prompting the use of other facilities like the Sterling Monetary Framework (STR) to make up for the reserve shortfall. He differentiates between quantitative easing (QE) and QT, emphasizing that repos are not QE but rather short-term secured loans that may become more prominent in the future, potentially shifting the asset mix from bonds to repos. The official suggests a return to historic practices of lending on a secured basis, marking a shift in monetary policy strategy. The Bank of England has lost billions due to interest rate risk with falling gilt prices and rising yields. Quantitative Easing (QE) transferred this risk from the private sector to the central bank, a process that Quantitative Tightening (QT) is now reversing. The BOE aims to transition from gilts to repos to eliminate interest rate risk, despite a slow process of unwinding significant gilt holdings. The shift to repos will likely result in increased repo operations in the future."

        "summary": "Wolf Richter discusses how the US Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) revised pricing data for new single-family houses during the pandemic, resulting in significant changes to the median prices. The revisions unwound 25% of the pandemic-era spike, reducing the median price peak in October 2022 by $36,000 and the three-month moving average peak by $38,000. The revisions were announced in three phases, with most adjustments being downward, before a slight upward adjustment in early 2024. The pandemic presented challenges in data collection, leading to issues with pricing data, but sales and inventory data for new single-family houses saw relatively minor revisions. The Census Bureau updated sales price range groups and introduced new price groupings in their time series file, affecting historical median and average sales price data from January 2020 to March 2024, as well as seasonally adjusted estimates of housing units sold, for sale, and months' supply of new housing revised back to January 2019."

Sales of mid-range homes declined, while high-end home sales surged, contributing to a drop in the seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales by 1.9% in April compared to previous years. Active listings hit the highest level since the pandemic started, with a 20% decrease in the market due to homeowners with 3% mortgages refraining from buying or selling their properties. New listings increased by 9.2% from the prior month, driving up active listings, as sellers grapple with realistic pricing and supply reached 3.5 months in April, the highest since 2020. The median price of single-family houses in April rose to $412,100, up by 5.6% year-over-year, mainly due to a shift in sales towards homes above $750,000, with a notable increase in those above $1,000,000. Condo prices also saw a record median price of $365,300 in April, reflecting a similar trend of shifting sales towards higher-end properties."

The share of ecommerce sales rose to 15.9%, the highest level since Q2 2020, indicating a continuous takeover of the retail market by ecommerce. While non-ecommerce retail trade has almost stagnated, with only a 0.3% rise in Q1, certain sectors like gas stations, food stores, and car dealerships have been shielded to some extent. However, shifts are on the horizon, with the online growth of groceries and used vehicle sales starting to make an impact. The article then delves into what Walmart revealed about ecommerce, noting a 22% surge in US online sales, significantly boosting overall comparable sales which rose by 3.8%. Without the growth in ecommerce, the overall figure would have only been 1.0%. Walmart's success in groceries has been paramount, with the company now the largest grocery store in the US.

        "summary": "Wolf discusses the increase in distressed debt exchanges as companies seek to deal with leveraged loan defaults. These exchanges offer an alternative to traditional bankruptcy court restructurings, allowing companies to negotiate with creditors and potentially swap out debt for equity. This trend reflects the challenges faced by highly leveraged companies in the current economic environment. Distressed debt exchanges significantly increase default numbers when included in default rates, with investors motivated by loose financial conditions to engage in these deals. Leveraged loans, popular among junk-rated companies, have led to a surge in exchanges since the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates. Despite rising defaults due to borrowers struggling with higher interest payments, leveraged-loan issuance has increased, while distressed debt exchanges remain prevalent in the junk bond realm."

This move is seen as a way to boost the mortgage industry post-refinance-mortgage collapse, with Freddie Mac proposing to securitize these mortgages for investor appeal. However, this strategy poses risks for homeowners, especially in declining markets where they may struggle with dual mortgage payments and potential personal liabilities for deficiencies on both mortgages.

Treasury securities have decreased by $1.25 trillion, while MBS holdings dropped by $368 billion due to slower home sales and refinancing. The Discount Window provides liquidity to banks at 5.5% interest, with $6.8 billion in loans in April. The Bank Term Funding Program decreased to $124 billion and will phase out by March 2025.

Delinquencies on floating-rate office CMBS loans have reached 20%, while fixed-rate loans stand at a much lower 4.7%.

The shift from fixed-rate to floating-rate office loans as interest rates increased has further complicated the situation. The overall delinquency rates for CMBS loans show the office sector as the worst-performing category, with multifamily and industrial sectors faring better. Despite some challenges, concerns persist over repayment defaults for fixed-rate loans and oversupply in the office market.

Powell expressed caution towards rate hikes, stating that it was unlikely the next move would be a hike.

Treasury bills under three months have been yielding over 5%, reflecting increased investor interest in short-term, low-risk investments backed by the Fed's rate hikes. As yields continue to rise, banks are compelled to offer competitive rates on CDs to retain and attract deposits, leading to a surge in large and small time-deposits. While T-bills have become popular among investors, banks are cautious about raising deposit rates to prevent a loyalty tax, despite customers having options to earn more elsewhere.

        "summary": "In a Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter, it is highlighted how major landlords like American Homes 4 Rent (AH4R) and Invitation Homes (IH) are focusing on the \"build-to-rent\" sector, with AH4R building 2,317 rental developments in 2023 and IH acquiring 1,789 single-family houses from homebuilders. Both AH4R and IH sold over 3,000 older houses in 2023 to shift towards expanding their build-to-rent portfolios, with AH4R selling 1,546 houses and IH selling 1,489 houses. D.R. Horton is also investing in this sector, with $3.1 billion in single-family build-to-rent properties. The article notes a trend of increasing build-to-rent single-family homes in communities, with 27,495 completed in 2023 and 45,400 under construction. This rise is attributed to high housing prices and mortgage rates, leading to more demand for rental homes over buying. Additionally, there is a surplus of new single-family houses available for potential homeowners, causing inventory levels to reach highs not seen since 2008."

Following major tenant vacancies, Blackstone wrote off its investment, leading to the tower's return to lenders. Two years later, Yellowstone Real Estate acquired the CMBS for about $200 million, a steep drop from Blackstone's purchase price, resulting in losses for investors, especially in lower-rated tranches. The potential conversion of the tower into residential units indicates a new chapter, but Wolf notes the extended timeline for planning, permitting, and construction, signaling that full recovery may take years. The article highlights differences in risk management between investors and banks, underscoring a cautious approach from banks towards CRE risks."

        "summary": "In a Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter, the author discusses how the prices of new houses have dropped by 18% from their peak, returning to November 2021 levels. This drop has been further influenced by mortgage rate reductions, making new homes more appealing to buyers. Homeowners holding onto vacant properties in hopes of lower mortgage rates have caused a convergence in prices between new and existing single-family homes. The median price of new homes has fallen more than existing homes, leading to a historic low 5-7% price difference between the two types of properties. Despite high mortgage rates, sales of new houses have remained steady, seeing a modest increase in March compared to a year ago. In contrast, sales of existing homes have plummeted by 29% since January 2019. The abundance of new houses for sale, reaching levels not seen since 2008, indicates a potential surplus that could impact prices and demand in the housing market."

Although the Fed experienced significant losses in 2023 due to negative spreads, its losses have since stabilized and decreased, with the smallest weekly losses in March and April 2024. The decrease in ON RRPs, currently at $441 billion, is a result of Quantitative Tightening (QT) draining balances before reserves, affecting the overall financial liquidity dynamics. Despite improvements, the Fed's interest income will continue to decline, delaying the point at which it breaks even. These losses impact the US Treasury, as the Fed remits its profits to the Treasury, contributing to deficits and debt."

The money fueling this surge is attributed to numerous factors like pay raises surpassing inflation, higher savings account returns, rent hikes, stock market growth, and contributions from immigrants in the workforce. This steady economic growth has left the Federal Reserve nervous, especially as high inflation persists and rate cut expectations wane.

While FDIC-insured commercial banks hold $2.4 trillion of these loans, making up roughly 10% of their total assets, the rest is held by various investors. The interconnectedness and risk-taking nature of the banking system leave it vulnerable to contagion, as seen with the collapse of three regional banks in 2023, although not due to bad CRE loans. The breakdown of banks' exposure to CRE loans by size reveals that large banks have 6% of their loans as CRE loans, mid-size banks have 17%, small banks have 31%, and tiny banks have 28%. Small banks with higher concentrations of CRE loans may be at risk of significant losses, posing a threat to the financial system, especially in times of economic instability."
