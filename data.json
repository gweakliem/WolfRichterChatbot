        "summary": "The Wolf Street article titled \"The Collapse of the EV SPACs: Nikola Joins EV SPAC Bankruptcy Lineup. Here Are Those Already Bankrupt, and Those Not Yet\" by Wolf Richter, explores the turmoil in the electric vehicle sector attributed to the decline of Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs). The introduction highlights the initial surge and subsequent financial struggles faced by these SPAC-backed EV companies, with Nikola's bankruptcy acting as the latest addition to these failures. In the section \"Nikola's Chapter 11 Filing,\" Nikola's collapse is detailed, emphasizing its financial mismanagement, the incarceration of ex-CEO Trevor Milton for fraud, and the inability to generate significant revenue despite a past valuation of over $28 billion. The section \"EV SPACs that are no longer twitching\" lists several SPAC-backed EV ventures like Electric Last Mile Solutions, Proterra, Lordstown Motors, and Fisker, all succumbing to financial collapse post-SPAC merger. Other failed companies include Lion Electric and Canoo, both filing for bankruptcy after unsuccessful market entries. Conversely, \"EV SPACs that are still twitching\" covers firms like Faraday Future, Mullen Automotive, VinFast Auto, Lucid Motors, and Polestar, which remain operational but struggling financially. Lucid Motors, though suffering significant losses, still produces high-end electric vehicles with aid from Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund. Rivian is an exception, having gone public through a traditional IPO and maintaining operations with support from Amazon and Volkswagen, although its share value has declined from its peak. The overall theme reflects the severe challenges faced by SPAC-backed EVs, emphasizing cautionary tales of speculative enthusiasm and financial mismanagement."

        "summary": "In the Wolf Street article titled \"Serious Delinquencies for Prime & Subprime: Our Drunken Sailors and their Auto Loans,\" the author, Wolf Richter, discusses the disparities between different types of auto loans, particularly highlighting the challenges faced by subprime borrowers with bad credit who contribute to only 14% of the market. In the \"Auto Debts\" section, Richter explains that despite an increase in vehicle sales, growth in auto loans has been modest due to a rise in cash purchases influenced by higher interest rates. The article points out that the auto-loan-to-income ratio has declined, indicating a reduced burden of auto debt on households, as discussed in the \"Auto-Loan-to-Income Ratio\" section. This decrease stems from disposable income growing at a faster rate than auto-loan balances, suggesting a moderation in consumer spending on auto loans. In the section \"Serious delinquency rates: total, subprime, and prime,\" Richter notes that the overall delinquency rate for auto loans and leases rose slightly to 1.58% in December 2024, with subprime loans showing a delinquency rate of 6.15%. Despite this, prime-rated auto loans face minimal delinquency due to their borrowers' financial stability. The article likens American consumers to \"drunken sailors\" because of their debt accumulation and financial challenges, a theme consistent across discussions on consumer credit, highlighting the urgency for better financial management. The article ultimately ends with a solicitation for reader support through donations to sustain Wolf Street's quality journalism."

It highlights how 21 major metropolitan markets in the US, including Austin, San Francisco, and Phoenix, have experienced property price declines below their 2022 peak levels, signaling a downturn from the pandemic-fueled boom due to factors like rising interest rates and shifting demand. Conversely, areas like Miami, San Diego, and Los Angeles are showing signs of slowing growth, while cities such as Baltimore, Kansas City, and Columbus continue to see stable growth, revealing regional disparities. The article underscores the uneven housing market recovery and emphasizes the importance of local economic conditions and supply. In \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET,\" January 2025 saw home prices drop in 32 out of 33 large metropolitan areas compared to December, with San Jose as the sole exception. The decline is attributed to high mortgage rates stabilizing around 7% following the Federal Reserve's policy changes. The article details metro-specific performance, with significant declines in Austin (-23.3%), San Francisco (-11%), and others, showing the impacts of policy shifts and speculative behavior. No metro reported notable price increases in January 2025, indicating a cooling market aligned with historical rates."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article, \"The Most Splendid Housing Bubbles in America, Jan 2024: The Price Drops & Gains in 33 of the Largest Housing Markets,\" by Wolf Richter examines the housing market dynamics in the US, highlighting price changes in 33 major metropolitan areas. Twenty-one metros, including Austin, San Francisco, Phoenix, and San Antonio, have seen a decline in housing prices from their 2022 peaks and have not fully recovered. Meanwhile, cities like Miami, San Diego, and Los Angeles initially exceeded 2022 price levels but are now experiencing reductions, indicating a shift in resilience. In contrast, Baltimore, Kansas City, and Washington D.C. have surpassed their 2022 prices without significant downturns, demonstrating resilience amidst broader economic influences. The other section, titled \"Home prices in January,\" details that prices fell across 32 large metros, excluding San Jose, where values stabilized for the fifth month. This variability is due to seasonal influences and the impact of the Federal Reserve's quantitative tightening, causing increased mortgage rates. Despite no metros achieving new highs in January 2025, the declines align with the end of the Fed's interest rate reprieve. Data showcases declines in cities such as Austin, San Francisco, and others, with percentage changes from 2022 highs and historical increases since 2000. While some metros face steep declines, areas like New York, Los Angeles, and Miami face lesser but persistent drops, emphasizing the diverse and uneven housing market influenced by distinct regional and economic factors."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter, \"Here Come the HELOCs: Mortgages, Housing-Debt-to-Income-Ratio, Serious Delinquencies & Foreclosures in Q4 2024,\" examines the late-2024 landscape of housing debt, highlighting the rise in Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) balances amidst minimal mortgage growth. Reflecting a shift in financial strategy, households increasingly tap into home equity, with HELOC balances seeing a notable increase of 2.3% quarter-on-quarter and 10% year-over-year, unlike new mortgages which saw a marginal $15 billion growth due to low existing home sales. Nearly half of recent HELOCs have limits between $50,000 and $150,000, a trend favoring HELOCs over cash-out refinancing to leverage existing low mortgage rates. The \"But here come the HELOCs\" section details this shift from cash-out refinancing, driven by higher mortgage rates, enabling borrowers to draw smaller amounts with interest only on used balances. The \"Burden of housing debt: Debt-to-Income Ratio\" section indicates that the housing debt-to-income ratio has decreased to a record low of 59.1% in Q4 2024, due to rising household incomes and stable housing debt, while mortgage rates remain predominantly low due to fixed rates that shield homeowners from financial turmoil. However, in cases of mortgage defaults, the risk is largely borne by investors and taxpayers because most residential mortgages are bundled into government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities. The concluding section, \"So far, so good,\" emphasizes the historical low in mortgage delinquencies at 0.70% and foreclosures, which remain subdued due to pandemic-related programs. Strong home price growth enables homeowners to sell properties above the owed amount, preventing delinquencies and preserving credit scores. Overall, the article articulates a landscape where household income growth and cautious financial behavior support housing stability despite the challenges."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article \"About that Retail Sales Plunge in the Headlines: A Romp through the Massive Seasonal Adjustments this Time of the Year\" by Wolf Richter delves into the intricacies of retail sales data and the effects of seasonal adjustments, particularly focusing on January's figures. The section titled \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET\" explains that although headlines reported a plunge in month-on-month retail sales due to a 0.9% decline after adjustment, actual sales increased by 4.8% year-over-year, evidencing the impact of seasonal trends. Richter emphasizes that although non-seasonally adjusted sales fell by 16.5% month-over-month, this fluctuation is normal given historical January sales declines ranging from 15% to 22%. The following section, \"Seasonal adjustments at the Big Three,\" illustrates how various retail sectors, such as auto and parts dealers, nonstore retailers, and food services, experience distinct seasonal patterns. For instance, auto dealers see their lowest sales in January, nonstore retailers drop sharply after December holidays, and food services record lower sales during winter months. Despite such declines, year-over-year sales for these categories grew, showcasing robust consumer activity. Finally, in \"So what does this mean?\", Richter concludes that the 4.8% year-over-year rise in January's retail sales does not indicate any significant change in consumer behavior, as fluctuations are expected and typically do not reflect broader economic trends. The article argues that examining year-over-year figures rather than month-to-month changes provides a clearer picture of retail sales trends, attributing discrepancies in data interpretation to extensive seasonal adjustments like those made using the Census Bureau\u2019s X-13 ARIMA-SEATS program."

        "summary": "The article \"Our Drunken Sailors\u2019 Debts in Q4 2024\" by Wolf Richter on Wolf Street details the state of household debts, disclosing that a surge in employment and income has contributed to increased household debt, as there are more people, workers, and overall income, leading to greater financial responsibilities. Despite the rise, debt is growing at a slower pace compared to income, resulting in a decrease in the debt burden relative to income and a debt-to-income ratio of 82.0% in the fourth quarter, the lowest since 2003. Subprime borrowers remain economically challenged, but the overall scenario shows improved consumer balance sheets, with many households owning assets and managing their debts effectively, even as higher interest rates persist. The article highlights how the end of the Free-Money period and mortgage-forbearance programs contributed to reduced delinquency, foreclosures, and bankruptcy rates, despite a slight increase in serious delinquencies to 2%, still lower than the 3% during 2018-2019. Meanwhile, third-party collections stay at historic lows of around 4.6%, with bankruptcy filings dipping significantly. This stability suggests a possible shift in household debt trends, with further insights on housing, credit card, and auto debt expected in subsequent articles."

        "summary": "\"Wolf Street\" discusses Producer Price Index (PPI) inflation acceleration to 3.5% year-over-year, the highest increase in two years, primarily driven by services accounting for about two-thirds of overall PPI. An upward revision in services inflation indicates entrenched inflationary pressures in the service sector, impacting overall PPI more than goods. Wolf Richter explains that January's PPI rose 3.51% year-over-year, the highest since February 2023, following December revisions from 3.31% to 3.48% due to service inflation revisions. Month-to-month PPI for final demand increased by 0.40% in January, with December inputs revised from 0.22% to 0.50%, causing a six-month PPI surge to 4.0% annualized, the highest since October 2022. Energy prices increased 1.7% in January, and food prices also rose. Core PPI, excluding food and energy, rose 0.28% in January after December revisions, reaching a six-month 3.8% annualized high. Year-over-year core PPI for December was revised up to 3.75% from 3.55%, with January at 3.61%. The services PPI was significantly revised in December and rose in January, making a six-month services PPI increase of 4.5% annualized. Core goods PPI remained stable with a 2.0% year-over-year increase, underscoring service inflationary pressures and rising consumer price inflation."

This is highlighted in the section titled \"PPI Inflation Accelerates to +3.5% yoy, Worst in 2 Years, Driven by Services amid Massive Up-Revisions in Services,\" where it is noted that services have seen significant cost pressures leading to upward revisions in prices. In the following section, \"By [Wolf Richter] for [WOLF STREET],\" it is detailed how massive upwards revisions for December, particularly in services, contributed to the noticeable increase in the PPI for January with a month-to-month rise of 0.40% after December's revised increase of 0.50%. Despite declining energy prices since mid-2022, recent increases potentially mask the inflation impacts within services sectors, and food prices rose by 1.1% in January, partially due to avian flu affecting egg production. The article also discusses the \"core\" PPI, excluding food and energy, which experienced significant revisions for December, contributing to an accelerated six-month annualized PPI growth to 3.8% in January, the steepest since September. While core year-over-year PPI growth slightly decelerated from December to January 2025, non-housing services showed a sharp acceleration aligning with PPI trends, underscoring inflation concerns primarily in services, as reflected in consumer price inflation tracked by the CPI."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article \"Beneath the Skin of CPI Inflation\" by Wolf Richter provides a comprehensive analysis of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and its significant components. In the \"CPI Inflation\" section, it highlights that October and January faced notable month-to-month inflation spikes due to increased costs in used vehicles, non-housing services, food, and energy. January's CPI rose 0.47% from December, led by durable goods prices, notably used vehicles, and non-housing services such as auto insurance and subscriptions. The \"Major Components\" section details year-over-year increases, with overall CPI up 3.0%, core CPI excluding volatile items like food and energy up 3.26%, and Core Services CPI experiencing sharp increases driven by core services and used vehicle prices. In \"Core Services,\" the article discusses how costs like motor vehicle maintenance and repair surged by 6.2% annualized in January, while insurance costs rose 26.7% annualized. \"Prices of Goods\" focus on used vehicles, which saw a 2.2% monthly rise in January, reversing previous declines and contributing to overall inflation. The \"Food Inflation\" section reports a 5.7% annualized increase in food prices for home consumption in January, the most significant rise since October 2022, driven by spikes in egg and other categories. \"Apparel and Footwear\" describes a 1.4% monthly decline in January, contributing to a subdued year-over-year rise, indicating moderation in pricing pressures. Finally, \"Energy\" explores the 1.8% increase in gasoline prices from December, nearly ending the year-over-year decline, while broader energy CPI, including various energy products, rose 1.1% from the previous month with categories like natural gas and heating oil exhibiting varying price changes. Overall, the article illustrates persistent inflationary pressures with significant shifts across services, goods, food, apparel, and energy sectors."

        "summary": "The article \"Treasury Market\u2019s Inflation Expectations Become 'Unanchored'\" by Wolf Richter on WOLF STREET explores the Federal Reserve's transition from cutting interest rates to a wait-and-see approach due to rising concerns over long-term interest rates and the increasing unpredictability, or \"unanchoring,\" of inflation expectations in the Treasury market. In the section by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET, it is highlighted that Fed Chair Jerome Powell, in his Senate testimony, insisted that longer-term inflation expectations remain \"well anchored\" according to surveys and financial market measures. Nonetheless, the bond market, which significantly influences Treasury trading, is showing signs of apprehension regarding inflation, as evidenced by the 5-year breakeven inflation rate reaching new highs, suggesting the growth in inflation expectations. This upward trend in inflation expectations has prompted the Fed to adopt a cautious wait-and-see approach, aiming to avoid further disturbing the bond market by refraining from additional rate cuts, despite existing pressures. The Fed's strategy is mainly to control inflation to ensure stability through moderate long-term interest rates, consistent with its mandate of achieving maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The current bias leans towards rate cuts rather than hikes unless there is a marked acceleration in inflation, which could necessitate rate hikes to mitigate bond market instability and rising long-term yields."

In the section \"Office attendance has barely ticked up in two years,\" data from Kastle's back-to-work barometer reveals that office occupancy is struggling to reach pre-COVID levels, with attendance in major markets averaging just 54% compared to pre-pandemic numbers, and dramatic dips on certain days of the week, notably Fridays. Furthermore, \"No decline in the share of WFH in 2023-2025\" discusses that despite hospitality and service employees returning to on-site roles, by January 2025 over 29% of full paid working days were from home, significantly higher than the 2019 level of 7%. By late 2024, 39% of full-time employees engaged in some form of remote work, highlighting its embedded place in workplace dynamics. Lastly, in \"Hopes that RTO will bail out the office sector seem premature,\" the article argues that many firms, such as Google and Apple, and even smaller businesses, have integrated hybrid work models, while others like Nvidia and Airbnb have no RTO mandates, instead building on remote work's benefits. These ongoing trends caution against expecting traditional office sectors to fully rebound to pre-pandemic occupancy, indicating that hopes tied to RTO saving the office sector are overly optimistic."

Inflationary pressures are building, as shown by a 0.4% increase in auction prices in January according to Manheim's Used Vehicle Value Index, with tax-refund season expected to further increase demand. There is a spotlight on price increases by power train, with used electric vehicles (EVs) experiencing a 2.1% rise from December to January, while used vehicles with internal combustion engines (ICE) saw a more modest increase. The inventory issue highlights ongoing supply challenges, with retail inventories down 5% from the previous year and 25% from 2019 due to past semiconductor shortages and reduced leasing activity. Retail prices U-turned as the used vehicle CPI showed a 1.2% increase in December, marking a reversal from previous declines in retail prices that had previously eased CPI inflation.

The section \"The Wolf Street article explores how recent immigration has impacted employment data in the U.S.\" emphasizes the Census Bureau\u2019s inclusion of recent immigrants, prompting a considerable adjustment in household survey data, leading to an increase of 2.23 million in employment and a 2.20 million increase in the labor force for January. Nonfarm payrolls showed a smaller increase, underscoring a disparity between employment measures, as seen in \"Nonfarm payrolls showed a smaller increase, highlighting a disparity between different measures of employment.\" The unemployment rate fell to 4.0%, and yet there was a robust job growth and a notable increase in average hourly earnings despite revisions showing lower job creation in past years, as mentioned in \"Additionally, the article discusses revisions to nonfarm payrolls data, which showed lower job creation in previous years than initially reported.\" The Fed, having concerns over delays in immigration data inclusion, as expressed in the section \"The Federal Reserve has expressed concerns over the delay in incorporating immigration data into labor statistics,\" now gains a clearer view of the labor market for monetary policy consideration thanks to these revisions."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter discusses the Federal Reserve's efforts to reduce its balance sheet through Quantitative Tightening (QT), with a notable reduction of $42 billion in January, bringing the overall balance down to $6.81 trillion, the lowest since May 2020. Since the end of Quantitative Easing (QE) in April 2022, the Fed has shed $2.15 trillion, or 24% of its total assets, reversing approximately 45% of the expansion seen during the pandemic. The article details QT assets by category, reporting a $25.2 billion reduction in Treasury securities in January, totaling a 46% decline since peak pandemic levels, with holdings now at $4.27 trillion. The Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) holdings saw a $15.7 billion reduction, marking a 19.1% decrease since April 2022 and a 38% decrease since peak pandemic levels. Due to limited mortgage activity, MBS reduction ranges between $15-17 billion monthly. The section on bank liquidity facilities highlights a decline in balances across five Fed facilities, including the expiration and significant drop in the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) launched in March 2023 due to bank arbitrage activities. The Discount Window's balance also decreased to $3.1 billion in January from a March peak of $153 billion during a banking panic. Despite Fred Chair Powell's urging for banks to use it more, the stigma and 4.5% interest rate limit its use. This overall QT effort aims to normalize the monetary policy landscape post-pandemic."

        "summary": "The article titled \"The Fed\u2019s QT Could Go on for a Lot Longer: The Tools Are in Place, incl. the Revived Standing Repo Facility\" by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street discusses the Federal Reserve's continued efforts in Quantitative Tightening (QT) and the tools supporting this process. QT has significantly reduced the volume of Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreements (ON RRPs) to below $80 billion, a dramatic decline from the $2.4 trillion peak in December 2022, bringing them near-zero levels reminiscent of pre-2008 financial conditions. Despite this reduction, reserve balances have remained stable at approximately $3.18 trillion since July 2022, indicating QT's primary goal of decreasing excess liquidity in the banking system hasn't been fully achieved. The Federal Reserve had lowered its ON RRP offering rate as a QT strategy, but this yielded minimal impact on reserve balances, with the further duration of QT likely hinging more on reserves than ON RRPs. Historical context highlights that, prior to 2008's Quantitative Easing, banks maintained near-zero excess reserves by utilizing the Federal Reserve's Standing Repo Facility (SRF) for managing liquidity. Anticipating QT needs, the Fed has revived the SRF to manage daily liquidity requirements, enabling banks to lend in the repo market to stabilize rates. This preparation helps avert market disruptions, such as the repo market turmoil of September 2019, and facilitates a gradual reduction of reserves. The Fed's robust tools, particularly the SRF, suggest that QT could feasibly continue for a longer duration without market disturbances."

        "summary": "The article by Wolf Richter on Wolf Street examines the US trade deficit situation in 2024. The \"Trade Deficit in Goods Worsens to All-Time Worst in 2024, Small Surplus in Services Rises, Overall Trade Deficit Worsens by 17%\" section highlights how the trade deficit in goods has reached a record high, mainly due to strategic moves by countries like Vietnam and Ireland that help companies bypass US tariffs and taxes. Despite a small increase in the services surplus, the overall deficit has worsened by 17%, reflecting corporate America's maneuvering to navigate trade and tax policies. The subsequent section, represented by Richter's name, provides further analysis on how the total trade deficit, which has risen to $918 billion, continues to hurt GDP and underscores the negative effects of globalization, which has marginalized US manufacturing. The article details how China's share of global manufacturing, at 31.6%, dwarfs that of the US, influencing employment and economic conditions negatively. Regarding trade specifics with China, a 7% deterioration is noted but is potentially understated due to rerouted goods through other countries. \"The US goods trade deficit, by country/region\" section discusses the role of third-country transshipments and tax avoidance strategies that elevate trade deficits. For example, trade deficits with Vietnam and Mexico rose significantly, and the deficit with Ireland surged 38% due to tax strategies, even surpassing Germany and Japan. Finally, the \"The 15 trade partners with which the US has the worst goods trade deficits\" section centers on the impact of tariffs on the economy, noting their effect on importers and stock performance, and hints at a forthcoming detailed analysis of US imports and exports by category. Overall, the article underscores the complexity of international trade policies and their repercussions on the US economy."

        "summary": "In \"Underlying Job Market Dynamics Retighten as Fed Moves any Rate Cuts into Distance amid Accelerating Inflation,\" Wolf Richter reports on the fluctuation and stabilization of the labor market. The article describes a low point in September that worried the Federal Reserve (the Fed) due to potential impacts on economic stability, but this concern has since diminished as the job market regains strength and inflation accelerates. Consequently, the Fed is more cautious about implementing rate cuts, indicating that such measures are postponed for now. In \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET,\" Richter analyzes whether pressure exists on the Fed to cut interest rates. He concludes there is no such pressure, as the labor market has slightly tightened with increasing inflation, supported by President Trump\u2019s agreement on a wait-and-see approach. In \"Recent data shows job openings,\" the article examines a minor decrease in job openings from previous months, though they remain high relative to pre-pandemic levels. The high number of job openings per unemployed person marks a tight labor market akin to conditions seen in 2018 and 2019, along with a rise in voluntary job quits indicating increased confidence among employees. Lastly, under \"Job hires rose in December,\" it is noted that hires have increased while layoffs and discharges are at historically low levels comparable to pre-pandemic times. This indicates a stabilized labor market where employers retain their workforce amidst tight conditions, reflecting an ongoing churn of job openings and hires."

        "summary": "The article, authored by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET, highlights President Donald Trump's agreement with the Federal Reserve's current \"wait-and-see\" approach to monetary policy amid ongoing inflation challenges. This temporary alignment follows previous tensions where Trump had criticized and pressured the Fed for its monetary policy decisions, particularly its interest rate hikes. The article emphasizes Trump's nuanced understanding of Americans' concerns about inflation and his current approval of the Fed's decision to maintain interest rates, reflecting his awareness of the Fed's role in price stability. Nonetheless, there is skepticism about how long this harmony will last, considering Trump's history of vocal demands for policy changes. The Federal Reserve is also making adjustments to align with the Trump administration's preferences, such as reviewing bank stress tests, withdrawing from the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), and planning a review of bank regulations. These shifts suggest the Fed's attempt to maintain its long-term autonomy while accommodating political pressures to some degree. Trump's recognition of inflation as a critical issue grants the Fed some leeway to manage it without immediate political interference, but challenges to the Fed's independence remain a concern."

ICE Vehicle Sales Dipped,\" provides a detailed analysis of the changing landscape in California's auto market during Q4 2024, highlighting significant shifts in Tesla's performance and broader trends in EV sales. During this period, non-Tesla electric vehicle (EV) sales in California rose by 19% year-over-year, reaching 50,616 units, which surpassed Tesla's declining sales of 43,658 vehicles\u2014an almost 8% drop from the previous year and the lowest since Q3 2022. While the Model Y remained the best-selling model, the Model 3's sales plummeted, falling from the second to the fourth position, with Toyota RAV4 and Camry models overtaking it. The overall auto market in California was stagnant, with total vehicle registrations (including internal combustion engine (ICE) and EVs) slightly dipping to 1.78 million, a steep decline from the 2 million range seen from 2015 to 2018. Tesla's market share in California shrank to 11.6%, while Toyota increased its share to 16.4%, and Honda closed in with 10.9%. Despite Tesla's sales dropping by 11.6% in California for the year, EV sales continued to grow by 1.2%, suggesting a strong consumer shift away from traditional fuel vehicles as ICE sales have decreased by 31% since 2016. On a global scale, Tesla's sales saw a slight decline of 1.1%, sparking discussions around its stock value and growth potential, particularly as there was no movement toward the launch of robotaxis in California. Meanwhile, Tesla's Cybertruck gained traction in the EV segment, securing the position of the fifth bestselling EV. These trends collectively illustrate a changing dynamic in California's auto industry, marked by a growing preference for a diverse range of EV brands."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter examines the effects of tariffs imposed during President Trump's administration between 2018 and 2019. Despite expectations of inflation resulting from increased costs for companies, the section \"Inflation did not accelerate\" reports that inflation did not accelerate; the core PCE price index remained below the 2% target, with durable goods experiencing essentially zero inflation as companies struggled to pass on costs to consumers. The section \"Customs duties more than doubled in less than two years\" notes customs duties more than doubled, from under $40 billion to an annual rate of $80 billion by Q3 2019 and reached nearly $110 billion by Q2 2022, demonstrating that while tariffs did not trigger inflation, they significantly increased government revenue. The article explains in \"Some basics about tariffs\" that tariffs are used to boost government revenue and influence domestic production dynamics, potentially leading foreign manufacturers to shift production to the U.S. to avoid tariffs. Although these tariffs benefitted the U.S. economy by promoting domestic production, they negatively impacted stock markets, as outlined in \"What Trump's Tariffs Did Last Time (2018-2019): No Impact on Inflation, Doubled Receipts from Customs Duties, and Hit Stocks,\" causing uncertainty and a decline in investor confidence, with the S&P 500 declining by 20% that year. Despite this, overvaluation presents a greater threat to the stock market than tariffs according to the article. Overall, the tariffs doubled customs receipts but did not cause the feared inflation and had a mixed impact on the economy and stock markets."

PCE Price Index Accelerates for 3rd Month: Justifies Fed\u2019s Pivot to Wait-and-See\" discusses the persistent inflation in core services, unchanged over eight months, and the acceleration of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index for three consecutive months. This situation upholds the Federal Reserve's wait-and-see stance on interest rates, as traditional methods have fallen short in achieving the desired inflation decrease. Since mid-2022, energy and durable goods prices fell, stabilizing inflation, but now these prices have stopped declining, while service inflation remains high since mid-2024, fueling overall inflation indices like the PCE price index. Even as durable goods prices showed no year-over-year change due to prior cooling, and now stabilize, they continue to pressure inflation, being pivotal in economic evaluations. The PCE price index and core PCE price index have risen above the Fed's 2% target, with core services significantly influencing persistent inflation. Under \"Month-to-month and six-month\", it is revealed that December saw a notable increase in the PCE price index by 0.26%, or 3.1% annually, and the core PCE price index rose by 0.16%, maintaining a 2.3% annual rate. Core services rose by 0.29% or 3.5% annually, unaffected for a year, with housing costs increasing to a 4.3% annualized rate. Food inflation, which had calmed after a 2022 spike, now starts to rise, with a 0.24% increase in December as the steepest in over a year. Energy prices sharply increased by 38% annually in December, the highest since August 2022, despite a slight year-over-year decrease, posing volatility challenges. The prior drop in energy prices that eased the PCE index may now wane with the recent rise."

The \"Buyers' Strike continued because prices are too high.\" section explains how potential buyers are deterred by high prices, with pending home sales and mortgage applications significantly declining. Even as home prices in cities like Austin, San Francisco, and New York City have dropped between 9% and over 20%, affordability concerns persist, keeping potential buyers hesitant. The \"Mortgage rates are back in the old-normal range.\" section informs that mortgage rates have normalized to pre-quantitative easing levels, stabilizing at an average of 6.95%, as the Federal Reserve has ceased its practice of purchasing mortgage-backed securities. Meanwhile, the \"Inventory of existing homes & new construction is piling up, particularly in the South and West.\" section reports an increase in the national supply of existing homes, notably in the South and West, with new completed house inventory reaching the highest levels since 2009. In the \"Buyers' Strike continued because prices are too high.\" section, it highlights the decline in pending home sales alongside high prices, freezing the resale market and affecting the brokerage and mortgage industries. The real estate industry\u2019s hopes for a recovery in existing home sales are dim as pending home sales fell significantly in December, reflecting a sustained decline over the years.

This surge, particularly in motor vehicles and recreational goods, spurred a 4.2% annualized growth in consumer spending, contributing to a 2.3% rise in real GDP despite downturns in private domestic investment and inventory changes. The annual real GDP growth for 2024 was 2.8%, surpassing the 15-year average, driven largely by consumer activity, which matched this growth rate. The \"final sales to private domestic purchasers\" metric rose 3.2% annually, reflecting robust domestic demand. Despite these positives, the debt-to-GDP ratio deteriorated to 121.8% by the fourth quarter due to increased national debts juxtaposed with modest GDP growth in current dollars, influenced by historical spending spikes and the 2020 lockdown's economic impact. Additionally, the trade deficit remained near-record levels as exports dipped slightly, but imports positively impacted GDP growth."

He highlighted the importance of reaching the Fed's 2% inflation target while avoiding adverse effects on the labor market. Powell assured that while the policy remains restrictive enough to aim for the inflation goal, more advancements are necessary. He dismissed setting a timeline for concluding Quantitative Tightening (QT), noting that reserves are still \"abundant\" but assured that the Fed keeps a close watch on when reserves might become scarce. Powell commented on high stock market valuations and potential financial stability impacts but affirmed that financial resilience remains robust, with strong bank capital and household finances.

The Committee aims for a 2% long-term inflation rate and maximum employment while considering potential risks to these goals balanced. As such, the target range for federal funds is kept between 4.25% and 4.50%, and ongoing monitoring of economic indicators such as labor market conditions, inflation trends, and global financial situations will influence future policy decisions. The Committee remains prepared to adjust policies if risks to employment and inflation goals arise, emphasizing thorough evaluations of new data and developments."

The Glut in the West Gets Close\" by Wolf Richter on Wolf Street, it is highlighted that the southern U.S. is facing an overwhelming supply of newly constructed houses, exceeding even the levels observed during the housing downturn of 2007. As of December, this inventory has surged by 76% since December 2019, totaling 301,000 homes, resulting in a 10-month supply range despite homebuilders offering incentives up to 10% of the sales price. Similarly, the Western U.S. is experiencing a parallel trend with inventory levels reaching the highest point since December 2007, reflecting a 35% increase since 2019 and an 11.3-month supply, leading to sluggish sales despite high prices. In his section \"The housing market in the Southern U.S.,\" Richter describes how sales in the South have dipped slightly from the previous year, with homebuilders using incentives to maintain activity amid the oversupply. In the West, as mentioned in his section \"In the Western U.S.,\" supply has reached significant levels due to tepid sales and high prices. The article also touches on \"The other two regions are not big players in the single-family market,\" where the Northeast and Midwest are not significant influencers in the U.S. single-family housing market due to a focus on multifamily projects which enhance urban density, with the Northeast seeing only 33,000 new houses sold in 2024, leading to a 17-month supply, and the Midwest experiencing increased inventory levels, leading to the highest figures since 2009. These regional dynamics highlight an imbalance in the national housing market, with high levels of inventory and stagnant sales, hinting at a potential market correction through price reductions or shifts in market conditions."

According to Wolf Richter's analysis for Wolf Street, \"Stimulate demand with lower prices, bigger incentives, smaller houses\" captures how big homebuilders, like D.R. Horton, tackle market conditions by offering large incentives to attract buyers. These strategies, including mortgage rate buydowns reaching up to 10% of selling prices in markets like Florida and Texas, are crucial despite affecting profit margins. However, \"But incentives are not reflected in the \u201cContract Price\u201d of the house,\" highlighting that while contract prices have dropped since their 2022 peak, they do not reflect these incentives, underlining the increased costs homebuilders incur. The \"Sales have been solid thanks to reduced prices & higher incentives\" section indicates that new home sales rose 12% year-over-year in December, contrasting with falling existing home sales. Overall, the inventory of unsold new homes rose significantly, challenging the \"housing shortage\" notion, with existing home sales plunging to 1995 levels due to extreme price hikes. While the surge in complete new homes offers market stabilization potential, the housing supply reaching 9.4 months suggests further price cuts could balance supply and demand."

        "summary": "The article \"DOGE Seeks to Shed Vast Amounts of Government Office Space\" by Wolf Richter on Wolf Street examines the government's initiative to significantly reduce its office space footprint, a trend that started during Donald Trump's presidency. The \"What office landlords and their lenders are facing\" section highlights the challenges for office landlords and their lenders, as the General Services Administration (GSA) considers terminating leases on millions of square feet of office space, potentially saving the government $1.87 billion annually by 2028. This move is in response to changing work environments, such as the rise of remote work, and aims to optimize efficiency and cut costs. The impact of these changes is crucial for the commercial real estate sector, which is coping with the effects of extended lease terms and seeking new strategies in a stabilizing post-pandemic market. The government's current leasing portfolio spans large amounts of office space nationwide, with a potential for significant downsizing or reorganization. The overall impact on the commercial real estate market will depend on how the government renegotiates or terminates its leases, influencing real estate markets across sectors and potentially exacerbating financial stress on landlords and lenders. The proposals to sell two-thirds of government-owned office space and terminate three-quarters of leased properties during Trump's term were driven by the underutilization and poor maintenance of many government buildings, particularly in Washington, D.C. This action could lead to depressed prices for older office buildings and a surge in defaults and foreclosures, amid an office mortgage crisis where commercial mortgage-backed securities delinquency rates soared to an unprecedented 11% by the end of 2024. The GSA's large footprint, especially in the Washington DC metro area and other major metros, and their significant lease termination rights add further pressure to an office real estate market already grappling with high vacancy rates and the rise of remote work trends."

        "summary": "In 2024, the real estate market faced its toughest year since 1995, largely due to a substantial 50% rise in home prices from 2019 to 2022, coupled with higher mortgage rates reaching 7%, reverting to pre-2009 levels, as noted in **\"Slowly getting used to the old normal 6-7% mortgages.\"** However, signs of improvement appeared, as seen in **\"Sales of Existing Homes Finally Begin to Thaw a Little, amid Highest Supply for December since 2018,\"** where the supply of homes for December was the highest since 2018, hinting at a shift towards a balanced market. Despite buyers and sellers adjusting to these conditions, 2024 still recorded the lowest sales since the Housing Bust years, impacted by affordability challenges. December's closing sales rose by 10.8% from the previous year but remained 36% below 2021 levels. The inventory of unsold homes reached 3.3 months, the highest since 2018, as stated in **\"Highest supply for any December since 2018.\"** Active listings have doubled since 2021 to 871,500, marking a 16% increase from last year, as detailed in **\"Active Listings doubled since 2021.\"** Homes stayed on the market for a median of 70 days, the longest since 2019, as described in **\"Days on the market lengthen to 70 days,\"** reflecting stagnant sales despite **\"Prices are too high\"** due to previous price spikes. Home prices varied significantly across regions, with major cities like Austin and San Francisco experiencing declines of 15-19% for single-family homes and 10-21% for condos and co-ops, indicating a disparity within the housing market, as highlighted in **\"But home prices vary widely by metro.\"** In terms of regional demand, the Northeast saw an increase to 530,000 homes, the Midwest slightly decreased to 990,000 homes, the South rose to 1.93 million homes, and the Western region increased to 790,000 homes, according to the **\"Demand destruction by region.\"**"

        "summary": "The article \"Collapse of the Solar Stocks\" by Wolf Richter from Wolf Street explores the recent downturn in solar stocks, attributing it to broader market phenomena such as fluctuating interest rates and macroeconomic challenges, rather than issues inherent to the solar industry itself. Despite strong industry fundamentals and the promising long-term potential of solar power, stock prices have faltered, demonstrating the speculative nature of the equities market where prices are often dictated by investor sentiment. Highlighted companies within the solar sector, like SunPower, which fell into bankruptcy by 2024 before being acquired by Complete Solaria, saw extreme stock price bubbles driven by speculative mania rather than company performance. Other mentioned companies, including SolarEdge Technologies, Sunrun, Enphase Energy, Shoals Technologies, Sunnova, and Array Technologies, also experienced notable stock price volatility before plummeting due to operational challenges and market shifts. In the section by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street, the article emphasizes that the financial challenges faced by these companies do not reflect the overall viability or growth potential of solar energy, which continues its expansion in the energy market due to improved economics from decreasing photovoltaic panel costs. It differentiates these solar-dedicated firms from larger, diversified energy companies like Tesla. The discussion touches upon the global photovoltaic panel manufacturing dominance of China and the nascent efforts in the US to develop similar capabilities. Ultimately, the article \"This is about stock market craziness, not about solar power,\" concludes that the solar sector's stock price activities are more about stock market volatility than the actual state of solar power itself."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article, authored by Wolf Richter, explores the surge in subprime auto-loan delinquencies while contrasting it with the stable condition of prime auto-loans. In the \"Subprime, Prime, and Overall Auto-Loan Delinquency Rates\" section, it explains that delinquency rates for subprime loans reached a concerning 6.15% in December, setting a record for that month according to Fitch data, whereas prime loan delinquencies remained low at 0.37%. The overall rising delinquency trend is attributed primarily to subprime rates, which suggests this issue is more structural within the subprime segment and not indicative of broader economic distress. The article notes in \"Why this surge in subprime auto-loan delinquencies?\" that the surge is driven by cyclical profit motives and historical securitization practices that originated in the 1990s. While subprime lending remains a small portion of the auto market \u2013 with significant cash transactions in both new and used vehicle purchases \u2013 the appeal of high returns attracts investors and dealers even amid the inherent risks. The article discusses the recurring cycles in the subprime market, which often lead to spikes in delinquency rates and subsequent tightening of credit standards. Despite the challenges and recent financial difficulties and bankruptcies reported in 2023, the subprime auto-loan market's profitability continues to draw interest. This cycle of aggressive lending and delinquency spikes suggests a systemic issue driven by the allure of financial returns, and this pattern is likely to persist."

        "summary": "In the Wolf Street article titled \"Locked-in Homeowners Nevertheless Pay Off Below-4% Mortgages: their Share of All Mortgages Outstanding Drops to 55%, Lowest since Q1 2021,\" Wolf Richter sheds light on the current trend of homeowners paying off low-interest mortgages, despite being \"locked-in\" at rates below 4%. Various life changes such as job shifts, policy changes regarding remote work, and natural disasters have compelled these homeowners to clear their loans, causing a decline in the share of sub-4% mortgages to 55%, the lowest level since early 2021, as noted in the section \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET.\" The percentage of mortgages with interest rates below 3% has also decreased, now making up 21.3% of all outstanding mortgages as of the third quarter of 2024, down from 24.6% in the first quarter of 2022. Adjustable-rate mortgages have fallen to 2.3% due to rising rates that significantly increase payments for homeowners. Homeowners are generally unwilling to sell due to the \"locked-in effect,\" leading to reduced market activity, and causing existing home sales to reach their lowest volume since 1995, negatively impacting the real estate sector. The \"Meanwhile\" section reveals that mortgages with rates above 6% have doubled to 17.2% of the market by Q3 2024, reflecting higher rates for new purchase and refinance mortgages. While historically low rates below 3% catalyzed a refinance boom between mid-2020 and late 2021, changing circumstances inevitably push even \"locked-in\" homeowners to consider higher-rate mortgages."

Focusing on both single-family houses and condos, the article reveals a broader trend of declining prices in urban areas, challenging the notion of a singular nationwide market by highlighting diverse local dynamics. In \"The biggest cities with the biggest price declines of single-family houses,\" it is reported that Austin experienced a 19.2% decline from its June 2022 peak, with similar steep drops in cities like Oakland, New Orleans, and San Francisco, reflecting a return to levels seen a few years prior. In \"The biggest cities with the biggest price declines of condos and co-ops,\" Austin's condo prices fell 21% from their June 2022 peak, while cities like Oakland, San Francisco, Detroit, New York City, and New Orleans experienced significant decreases from recent peaks, yet all regions have still achieved substantial long-term growth since 2000. The Zillow Home Value Index was used for data, smoothing out seasonal variations to provide an alternative view to median prices, revealing that despite short-term declines, many cities still enjoy overall growth since the beginning of the millennium."

Single-family construction starts surged to 1.01 million properties, marking a 6.5% increase and reaching the second-highest level since 2007, which led to an overstock of completed homes as construction outpaced sales. Homebuilders responded by reducing prices and offering incentives to manage this glut. In contrast, multifamily construction starts plummeted by 25% from 2023 and 35% since their peak in 2022, driven by market oversupply, financing challenges, and poor returns due to high-interest rates. Most multifamily projects launched were large-scale, which suffered amid commercial real estate sector difficulties. However, smaller multifamily buildings with 2-4 units increased their starts by 36% in 2024, showing resilience against the commercial real estate downturn. High-end multifamily projects in cities attracted affluent renters, while single-family constructions in suburbs adopted \"build to rent\" models, aiding large landlords in asset management."

        "summary": "The article from Wolf Street by Wolf Richter, \"ECB Faces a Problem: Euro Area Services Inflation Stuck at 4.0% for 13th Month. CPI Accelerates Further, as Energy & Durable Goods Stopped Plunging,\" discusses the European Central Bank's (ECB) struggle with persistent services inflation within the Euro Area, which has remained at 4.0% for 13 months. The article highlights that this high rate is particularly driven by non-housing related services, as housing service CPI slightly decreased to 3.3%. The ECB is concerned about this due to strong wage pressures and delayed price adjustments from past inflation peaks. Moreover, the Euro Area's Core CPI\u2014excluding food, energy, tobacco, and alcohol\u2014rose by 2.7% in December and has been constant in this range for nine months, driven mostly by services inflation and the stabilization of durable goods prices, which could now push the Core CPI away from the ECB's target if it turns positive. The overall Consumer Price Index (CPI) recorded a rise to 2.4%, continuing its upward trend due to the halt in energy and durable goods deflation and steady food prices. The ECB is now faced with a precarious balancing act as any further cuts in rates may result in the inflation rates surpassing the policy rates, likely worsening the inflation issue instead of mitigating it."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article, authored by Wolf Richter, provides a detailed examination of inflation as reflected by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). In December, the year-over-year CPI climbed by 2.9%, marking the highest since July, with a monthly surge of 0.39%, translating to a 4.8% annualized rate, the most significant hike since February. Core CPI, excluding food and energy, has remained stable for seven months between 3.1% and 3.3%, indicating persistent underlying inflation pressures. Categories like used and new vehicles, food, and energy, previously contributors to easing CPI, have reversed trends, causing upward pressure. Overall CPI's stabilization is further analyzed under \u201cCore services\u201d CPI, where it experienced a slower annualized growth rate at 3.2% in December, with a six-month core services CPI rising to 4.0% annualized, its peak since August. The housing components of core services section emphasizes how the Owners\u2019 Equivalent of Rent CPI and Rent of Primary Residence CPI, while decelerating year-over-year, remain considerably elevated, reflecting the indirect expenses of homeownership and pre-pandemic normality breaches. In Prices of Goods, used vehicles experienced a 1.2% rise from November, diminishing its year-over-year drop to 3.2%. Meanwhile, new vehicles saw a 0.47% monthly increase, marking solid price levels despite manufacturing surpluses, and underscoring the impact of growing electric vehicle demand. Food inflation shows a notable 3.9% annualized increase for \"Food at home\" items in December, a peak escalation since October 2023, with detailed impacts like a 36.8% rise in egg prices due to avian flu. The apparel and footwear CPI posted a 0.1% monthly rise and a 1.2% year-over-year jump, pointing toward moderate inflation in these nondurable goods. Energy CPI rose by 2.6% from November, reducing its annual decline to 0.5%. Gasoline prices, contributing approximately half of this category, increased by 4.4% month-over-month but still showing a 3.4% year-over-year drop since notable declines starting summer 2022, a key factor in overall CPI slowdown. Hence, the interplay of rising food and energy costs, along with evolving vehicle pricing trends, is significantly impacting the inflation landscape described in the article."

A key contributor to this increase is the inflation within core services, constituting two-thirds of the PPI, which rose by a substantial 4.0%. This suggests that inflationary pressures in the service sectors are intensifying, playing a significant role in the overall PPI trend and potentially impacting the broader economy in 2024. The December PPI recorded a 3.31% year-over-year increase, the highest since February 2023, with services inflation reaching 4.03%. The PPI's increase reflects an intention by businesses to transfer rising service sector costs to consumers. On a month-over-month basis, the PPI for final demand increased by 0.22%, equivalent to an annualized rate of 2.7%, with energy prices ending their decline to rise by 3.5% in December. While food prices dropped slightly month-to-month, they saw a year-over-year rise of 4.7%.

However, cities such as Washington D.C., Miami, Boston, and Atlanta maintain stable prices, reflecting diverse local conditions. This cooling off follows a period of rapid growth driven by economic concerns, interest rate changes, and shifting buyer behavior. The segment \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET\" discusses broader market conditions, noting a reversion to 7% mortgage rates, the lowest existing home demand since 1995, and rising competition from homebuilders. This has led to uneven price movements, with some areas experiencing substantial drops while others remain stable or progressive. According to \"The first 21 metros here are all below their highs in mid-2022, sorted by magnitude of decline\", Austin, San Francisco, Phoenix, San Antonio, and Denver are among metros seeing significant price declines, while Seattle and San Jose report year-over-year increases despite minor drops from 2022 peaks. \"The next 12 markets have set new highs in 2023 or 2024, sorted by year-over-year gain\" highlights metros like Miami, Baltimore, San Diego, and Kansas City achieving new highs recently, with Miami seeing the largest increase since 2000. While these markets exhibit long-term growth since 2000, individual cities within these metros can perform differently, as seen in Washington D.C.'s mixed results between the overall metro and the city.

        "summary": "In the Wolf Street article, Wolf Richter outlines the recent developments in the Treasury yield curve, highlighting how long-term yields are approaching 5% while short-term yields stay constant, post the Federal Reserve's rate cuts. This trend suggests a steepening of the yield curve since its inversion in 2022, with 2-year and longer-term maturities seeing significant increases after the Fed's 100 basis points rate cut, which stands in contrast to the usual expectations of economic downturns associated with rising longer-term yields. 'The yield curve un-inverted last year and is steepening nicely,' but remains fairly flat with a 37-basis-point spread, as explained in 'The yield curve is still fairly flat and has some ways to go.' The solid labor market, fast economic growth, and re-accelerating inflation have pushed the Fed into a wait-and-see stance. This shift has also impacted mortgage rates, which have surged to 7.24% from historically low levels seen during extensive Federal Reserve interventions post-2009, as discussed in 'Getting used to the old-normal 6% to 8% mortgages?' Consequently, there are now notable increases in yields, with 30-year Treasury bonds being auctioned at their highest yields since 2007, indicating a potential return to pre-2008 mortgage norms. Despite this, markets do not foresee imminent rate cuts, maintaining short-term yield stability."

According to Wolf Richter, in December, nonfarm payrolls increased by 256,000, resulting in a total of 159.5 million jobs, with a three-month average increase aligning with previous months and marking the largest rise since May. Over the past year, employers added 2.23 million jobs, exceeding the pre-pandemic average by 5%, indicating robust job growth despite higher interest rates. The labor market's strength and economic growth have led to speculation that the Fed's policy rates may be nearing neutrality, reducing the need for further cuts. Inflation risks have also minimized the chances of rate cuts, in line with a 3.4% annualized rise in average hourly earnings in December, with a year-over-year increase of 3.9%. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1% in December, the lowest unrounded rate since June, and maintained this average over seven months, showcasing stabilization at healthy levels. In the section titled \"Employment to be adjusted in February for 8 million new legal and illegal migrants,\" the Census Bureau's updated population data indicates an increase of 8.01 million people, mainly due to immigration, which hasn't been included in current employment statistics but will be in February's report. This represents the largest U.S. population jump in 23 years, expected to lead to significant employment metric adjustments. Adjustments aim to restore the historical relationship between household survey and nonfarm payroll figures, with the household survey traditionally reporting higher employment numbers. This gap has narrowed but is set to widen again with February's adjustments, changing the household employment margin over nonfarm payroll numbers."

        "summary": "The article \"Bond Market Rout\" in the UK, highlighted on Wolf Street and authored by Wolf Richter, examines the significant rise in UK government bond yields, drawing parallels with the US bond market. The 10-year yield in the UK has surged to 4.82%, marking its highest level since 2008, while the 30-year yield reached 5.47%, the highest since 1998, surpassing US Treasury yields. This uptick has sparked notable discussions in financial media, with phrases like \"gilt market rout\" and \"return of the bond vigilantes\" gaining popularity. This shift in yields occurs after years of extremely low interest rates driven by global interest rate suppression, largely due to actions like the Bank of England's quantitative easing (QE) and maintenance of minimal rates. Back in July 2020, the 10-year gilt yield fell to a historic low of 0.09%, with expectations of potentially turning negative, perpetuating a 40-year bond bull market. The resurgence of inflation, however, prompted interest rate hikes by the Bank of England, bringing the 10-year yield back to pre-ZIRP normalcy. The article suggests that this return to more typical yield levels is crucial, fostering necessary fiscal discipline among governments and investors, and correcting the imbalances fostered during the era of cheap borrowing costs. This transition, though challenging, is ultimately beneficial, as a normal cost of capital is essential for reestablishing a sustainable and disciplined fiscal environment."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article titled \"Why Used-Vehicle Prices May Put Upward Pressure on CPI, after Having Been a Powerful Contributor to Cooling Inflation\" by Wolf Richter explores the factors influencing used vehicle prices and their impact on the consumer price index (CPI). The piece discusses how new-vehicle shortages from 2021 and 2022 have curtailed the supply of used cars, though demand remains strong, leading to potential upward pressure on prices and, consequently, the CPI. In the section \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET,\" it is noted that after contributing to inflation between 2020-2021, used-vehicle prices declined in 2022-2023, which helped lower overall inflation rates. However, this downward trend leveled off by 2024 due to tight inventory and sustained demand, particularly from rental fleets and lease terminations, reversing the year-over-year decline that began in August 2022. The section \"Prices are still too high, by powertrain: ICE and EV\" highlights the severe price increases for both internal combustion engine (ICE) and electric vehicles (EV), spurred by factors like access to \"free money\" during 2020-2021. Despite some deflation, ICE and EV prices remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. A constrained supply of new vehicles, largely due to semiconductor shortages impacting global production in 2021 and 2022, has greatly reduced the supply of used vehicles, exacerbated by shortages in rental fleets and lease terminations, with this tightness forecasted to persist until 2026, as detailed in the section \"Pushing up into inflation figures.\" This supply crunch contrasts with solid demand, reflected in a 13% year-over-year increase in used vehicle retail sales in December. The section also notes that the significant 28% drop in the CPI for used vehicles from early 2022 to mid-2024, which helped calm core inflation, stalled at mid-2024 with prices increasing 5.1% between September and November. Despite a 3.4% yearly decrease in November, it's expected that the year-over-year figures will soon turn positive, driven by last year's low numbers, with December CPI data anticipated to further illuminate this trend."

        "summary": "The article, \"Labor Market Dynamics Retighten, Job Openings Jump Again. Fed Faces Scenario of Solid Job Market, Re-accelerating Inflation | Wolf Street\" by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET, discusses the recent developments in the US labor market, where job openings in November increased to 8.10 million, the highest since May. This indicates a strong demand for labor, despite a decrease in voluntary quits to 3.06 million. Notably, sectors like professional and business services, as well as finance, have seen substantial increases in job openings, pointing to the creation of new positions rather than filling existing ones. The article highlights the challenge this robust job market poses for the Federal Reserve, which is now more cautious about potential interest rate cuts due to the risk of re-accelerating inflation. Consequently, the Fed has altered its expectations, now projecting only two 25-basis-point cuts and raising its inflation and federal funds rate projections. The number of job openings per unemployed person has risen to 1.13, reflecting labor-market tightness. Even though layoffs and discharges have slightly increased to 1.76 million, the layoff rate remains historically low at 1.11%, suggesting that employers are retaining workers. However, hiring has declined by 125,000 to a total of 5.27 million, marking a second consecutive month of decreases, indicating that employers are holding onto their workforce while creating new job opportunities, contrary to the reduced need for replacements due to fewer layoffs and voluntary quits. This situation underscores the complexity the Fed faces in balancing economic growth and inflation control, as it carefully monitors these economic indicators to guide future monetary policy decisions."

The section \"Bank of Japan Balance Sheet: QT Takes Off, Assets Drop to Lowest in 15 Months\" details how the BOJ is systematically reducing its balance sheet since mid-2022, particularly in government securities and loans, reflecting a strategic shift from QE strategies towards a restrictive monetary policy approach. The \"The yen paid the price for QE in 2012-2022\" section highlights the devaluation of the yen by 46% against the US dollar due to QE and its impact on inflation, which reached 2.9% in November 2024. In \"Due to persistent trade deficits, the crushed yen is not good for Japan,\" the article outlines how the weakened yen worsens Japan's trade deficits, making imports more expensive and contributing to inflation, while offering only nominal benefits to Japanese manufacturers who have offshored production. Despite the BOJ's shifts, these challenges suggest that the yen's position might not be quickly strengthened."

Lastly, \"The other diversification: gold\" section describes central banks' increased gold holdings over the past decade, with total reserves reaching 1.16 billion troy ounces valued at $3.08 trillion in contrast to foreign exchange reserves at $12.3 trillion.

EV Sales +10% despite Tesla\u2019s Dip\" by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street provides an overview of the US auto industry in 2024, highlighting a mix of challenges and achievements. Stellantis faces a severe downturn, described as a catastrophe, while General Motors, Toyota, Ford, and Honda report increased sales, though still below their peaks. Hyundai-Kia achieves a record-breaking performance, moving to fourth place in sales behind GM, Toyota, and Ford. Total new-vehicle sales rise by approximately 2.3% to around 15.8 million, with electric vehicle (EV) sales surging by 10% to 1.3 million units despite Tesla's sales stalling. This trend signals a shift towards EVs amid broader market dynamics. The article notes that even with these rises, vehicle sales remain below 1986 levels, with 2024 sales figures showing a 9% decrease from the peak year 2000. \"Prices are too high\" comments on automakers' premium model focus and price increases leading to stagnant volumes and high prices. December\u2019s average retail vehicle price was $46,200, stable from the previous year, following a pandemic-driven surge from December 2019 to December 2022. \"The biggest automakers in the US\" identifies General Motors as the largest U.S. automaker with a 4.3% sales increase, despite being 12% below its 2015 peak. Its EV sales soared by 50.8% and now account for 4.2% of total sales. Toyota increased sales by 3.7% and has ramped up EV development under new leadership, still trailing in EV market share. Ford's sales grew by 4.2%, with a 20% decline from its 2015 peak, and a 34.9% rise in EV sales. Hyundai-Kia set a new sales record, with EVs making up 7% of their total. Honda's sales rose by 8.8% while facing potential mergers with Nissan due to declining sales. Stellantis saw a 15% sales drop and a leadership change, and Tesla reportedly experienced a dip in U.S. sales amid rising EV competition."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter provides an update on the Federal Reserve's balance sheet and its quantitative tightening strategy as of December. According to the \"Fed Balance Sheet QT\" section, the Fed reduced its balance sheet by $43 billion in December, bringing the total to $6.85 trillion, which marks a $2.11 trillion decline from its peak and amounts to a 23.6% decrease. This reduction highlights the Fed's post-pandemic reversal, where it has already trimmed 44% of the $4.81 trillion balance sheet increase from the pandemic era. The \"QT assets by category\" section explains that the Fed reduced its Treasury securities by $24.5 billion in December, marking a 26% decline since June 2022. This aligns with the broader plan to unwind $3.27 trillion in pandemic-acquired Treasuries, with 45% already offloaded. The article notes a shift as global investors take up more U.S. national debt, which now stands at $36.1 trillion in total, with $28.87 trillion held publicly. The \"Bank liquidity facilities\" section highlights the status of the Fed's bank liquidity measures, newly focused on the Discount Window and Bank Term Funding Program as other facilities have minimal balances. The balance of the BTFP dropped sharply after a market-rate flaw was exploited, leading to a temporary spike before correction, and no new loans have been issued since, with the program set to end in March 2024. The Discount Window has slightly increased to $3.2 billion in December, far beneath the $153 billion peak during the March 2023 bank panic. With the Fed charging 4.50% interest and requiring collateral, Chair Jerome Powell has pushed for banks to use the Discount Window more regularly and to prepare for transitional transactions to ensure readiness for future requirements."

Automaker, Stagnating Vehicle Sales like General Motors & Ford, Getting Overtaken by Competitors, Losing Share in the Booming EV Market?\" by Wolf Richter examines Tesla\u2019s declining position in the electric vehicle market. Tesla, previously a leader in the EV space, is now encountering intensified competition from established automakers and newcomers. Its vehicle sales growth has stalled, paralleling trends seen in traditional automakers like General Motors and Ford. In 2024, Tesla's global deliveries declined by 1.1% to 1.789 million vehicles, with a modest Q4 growth of 2.3%. In contrast, competitors like China's BYD saw a 12% increase in EV deliveries, overtaking Tesla in Q4. Other Chinese manufacturers, such as Li Auto, Nio, and Xpeng, also reported significant sales growth. In the U.S., companies like General Motors and Ford recorded substantial increases in EV sales, with Ford rising 45% and General Motors 24%, even after discontinuing the Bolt series. The auto industry, challenged by slow internal combustion engine sales, witnessed rising EV demand, though Tesla\u2019s performance was underwhelming, contributing only a 10% increase in U.S. EV sales in 2024. As the dominance of Tesla wanes amidst a growing EV landscape, \"So how much should Tesla be worth?\" questions Tesla's stock valuation amidst stagnating sales and robust competition. Tesla's P/E ratio of 103.2 starkly contrasts with Ford's and General Motors', suggesting it should realign closer to industry norms, perhaps around a P/E ratio of 15. Despite successfully becoming a profitable global automaker with $33 billion in cash, Tesla faces challenges as a mid-sized player in a competitive market. Its significant influence in encouraging traditional automakers to invest in EVs is acknowledged, yet the article suggests that Tesla's stock should now reflect its evolved market role and trade similarly to its automotive peers in General Motors and Ford, despite ongoing Wall Street hype."

The S&P 500's outperformance is partly due to currency fluctuations, with the depreciation of the Japanese yen and Indian rupee decreasing returns for USD investors in those stocks. It underscores the importance of considering currency risks in international investing. In the Global Stocks over the Long Term section, it attributes the S&P 500's dramatic 253% increase since May 2013 largely to aggressive monetary policies like the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing. However, the shift to quantitative tightening by the Federal Reserve and actions by other central banks like the European Central Bank may reverse the liquidity-driven growth that benefited the S&P 500. In the Foreign Stock Markets section, the article notes the substantial local currency gains of Japanese and Indian markets since 2010, which were eroded for US investors due to currency depreciation. It also reviews other key indices like China's SSE and Hong Kong's HSI, detailing their performance metrics and long-term trends."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter titled \"Office CMBS Delinquency Rate Spikes to a Record 11%, Blowing by the Financial Crisis Peak,\" discusses the severe challenges faced by the office real estate market, highlighted by the office Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (CMBS) delinquency rate hitting a record 11% in December. This rate surpasses the previous peak during the financial crisis, following a 9.4 percentage point increase over the past two years, indicating significant deterioration in the office sector compared to other commercial real estate sectors like lodging and retail. The article attributes this financial distress to remote work trends, oversupply of office space, and rising interest rates. The \"extend and pretend\" strategy, mainly involving temporary debt deferral, is proving unsustainable as it fails to address the core issue of excess office space worsened by pandemic-driven changes and increased vacancies. While there are rumors of potential debt renegotiations and write-offs, converting office spaces to residential use remains viable only for select buildings. Despite US banks holding substantial office loans and initiating some write-downs, the distribution of office mortgage debt globally reduces the potential risk impact on the US banking system. The overall office debt, less than $1 trillion, does not pose a critical threat to the broader banking infrastructure. With defaults rising, the outlook for office space-related investments remains uncertain, making the situation urgent for finding viable solutions amid the ongoing office debt meltdown."

        "summary": "The article titled \"Buyers\u2019 Strike Continues: Pending Home Sales Remain Deep in the Frozen Zone though up a Tad from Rock Bottom\" from Wolf Street highlights the significant downturn in the US housing market, characterized by a persistent reluctance from buyers amid high home prices. According to Wolf Richter, despite a slight rise in pending home sales from historic lows, the current levels remain weak due to ongoing high costs, leading to a buyers' strike where potential purchasers leverage improved negotiating power. The National Association of Realtors (NAR) reports that November saw a 20.1% drop in sales, influenced by Thanksgiving, but seasonal adjustments indicated a minor increase. Historical analysis reveals fluctuating November trends over recent years, while pending sales by region showed that although the South saw a notable increase in seasonally adjusted figures, all regions experienced significant declines without adjustments. NAR also notes that buyers are acclimating to stable, higher mortgage rates above 6%, adjusting market dynamics in favor of buyers and away from the previous seller-dominated market. With mortgage rates back in the old-normal range, the article notes their increase to 6.85% in late December, reflecting a return to pre-quantitative easing era levels, with analysts predicting ultra-low rates are unlikely to return. Supply is piling up as new home inventory increases, with homebuilders offering incentives like mortgage-rate buydowns, bolstering new home sales despite a decline in existing home sales. Inventory has grown by 8.1% on a year-over-year basis, signaling a significant rise in housing stock. However, the buyers\u2019 strike continued into December, with mortgage applications showing only a slight improvement from last year's extreme lows but still markedly below levels seen in 2019, 2021, and last year, indicating an ongoing stagnation in home buying activity despite minor gains."

The section \"The yield curve steepened nicely after un-inverting entirely.\" explains that longer-term Treasury yields have risen, prompting a steepening of the yield curve after it fully un-inverted, with short-term yields stable. The divergence, as explored in \"Why the divergence of the 10-year yield from the EFFR?\" arises from robust economic growth and a strong labor market, conditions typically correlating with higher yields, even as the Fed reduced rates due to easing inflation. \"The bond market is getting a wee bit nervous.\" highlights market anxieties over inflation reemergence, driven by US fiscal policies and deficits, alongside the Fed's shift in cut projections, necessitating higher yields to attract buyers amidst Quantitative Tightening. Further, \"Mortgage rates back around 7%.\" discusses the rise in mortgage rates post-September cut, returning to historically normal levels, causing frustration in real estate but indicating a return to pre-2008 crisis norms. This complex landscape suggests market forces responding to broader economic signals beyond Fed actions."

The Federal Reserve, despite reducing its holdings through its Quantitative Tightening program, still retains 15.4% of the debt. The article delineates in \"Who held this $35.46 trillion in Treasury securities at the end of Q3?\" that US government entities held $7.16 trillion internally through mechanisms like federal civilian and military pension funds and other trust funds, while $28.31 trillion is controlled by the \"public.\" In \"Who is this \u2018public\u2019?\" it is revealed that foreign investors hold $8.67 trillion or 30.6%, with major players like financial centers and countries such as the Euro Area, Japan, and China-Hong Kong, although China's investments have declined while the Euro Area has supplemented this gap. US mutual funds represent 17.6% of the public debt, US individuals hold 10.3%, state and local governments, including pension funds, account for 6.4%, and commercial banks hold 6.1%. The article ends by addressing concerns in the section \"An analysis of the US national debt highlights a troubling trend,\" highlighting the worsening fiscal health due to an unprecedented spike in the Interest-Payments-to-Tax-Receipts ratio and growing debt-to-GDP ratio, urging the need for strategies to manage the high-interest payments for fiscal sustainability."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter titled \"Glut of New Completed Single-Family Houses for Sale Spikes to Highest since 2007, Prices Drop to Lowest since 2021 But Are Still Way too High\" discusses the significant increase in the number of completed single-family houses available for sale, reaching a high not seen since 2007. As a result, home prices have decreased to the lowest since 2021, yet they remain elevated. Homebuilder Lennar plans to cut prices by 16% from the 2022 peak to manage oversupply and boost demand. In November, unsold new houses soared by 57% year-over-year to 124,000, the highest since June 2009 during the Housing Bust, based on Census Bureau data. Homebuilders are employing strategies such as lowering prices and enhancing incentives to attract buyers, yet unsold inventories across all construction stages still increased by 8.1% year-over-year to 493,000 houses, the highest since December 2007, causing pressure on prices and challenges for homebuilders. In the \"Prices Drop, Incentives Surge\" section, it is emphasized that big homebuilders like Lennar are aggressively lowering prices and offering incentives to maintain sales, leading to squeezed profit margins. The median contract price for new homes dropped significantly, reaching $402,600, and Lennar reported a decline in sales revenue and lower average sales prices, projecting further declines and refraining from full-year guidance due to uncertain market conditions. The \"Sales are Decent, Thanks to Price Cuts and Incentives\" section highlights sales increases driven by price reductions and incentives, with a 14% rise from last year and a 33% increase over two years, projecting 681,000 annual sales for new houses, surpassing any year in the previous 11-year period. However, sales of existing single-family houses have sharply declined to their lowest since 1995 due to sellers maintaining high prices, which reduces demand. Lastly, the \"Prices of New Houses versus Existing Houses\" section notes that while new houses have historically been priced higher than existing ones, this trend is shifting as incentives make monthly payments for new homes more competitive, sustaining homebuilders' sales and causing a decrease in existing home sales."

        "summary": "The article \"Treasury Yield Curve Un-Inverts Entirely, as Long-Term Yields Rise while Short-Term Yields Stay Put, No Longer Pricing in Rate Cuts. Mortgage Rates back Above 7% | Wolf Street\" by Wolf Richter discusses significant developments in the Treasury yield curve, which has fully \"un-inverted\" due to rising long-term yields while short-term yields stabilize, indicating markets are not anticipating further rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Despite a 100 basis point cut since September, the 10-year Treasury yield has surged by 87 basis points, raising questions about future rate reductions, consequently pushing mortgage rates above 7% and tightening financing conditions for homeowners. The section authored by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street outlines the Federal Reserve's recent 25 basis point rate cut projecting higher inflation and fewer rate cuts by 2025, which, paired with Jerome Powell's comments about a recalibration phase possibly ending, impacted market sentiment and resulted in a 3% drop in the S&P 500. This announcement led to unchanged short-term yields and diminished expectations for short-term rate cuts. In the section \"The entire yield curve un-inverted entirely,\" we learn that both 10-year and 30-year yields have risen, following an inversion that started in July 2022. Although the yield curve remains flat, there is a slight 22-basis point difference between the 2-year and 10-year yields, with a potential future steepening to normalize. In \"Yields v. the Effective Federal Funds Rate,\" after the Federal Reserve adjusted the target for the Effective Federal Funds Rate (EFFR), resulting in lower rates, varied Treasury yield movements were noted, with longer-term yields displaying a steepened curve surpassing the EFFR. As noted in \"Mortgage rates back above 7%,\" the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has exceeded 7%, up from 6.11%, paralleling the 10-year Treasury yield rise and maintaining a wide spread reminiscent of levels seen before the 2008 financial crisis."

This decrease resulted from the Fed's decision to cut the ON RRP rate by five basis points, complementing an overall 25-basis-point policy rate cut. The goal is to push money market funds toward higher-yielding alternatives like Treasury bills, redistributing excess liquidity that the Fed accumulated during quantitative easing (QE). These funds are the primary users of ON RRP, which currently contains surplus liquidity. As part of its quantitative tightening (QT) initiative, the Fed has withdrawn $2.1 trillion, mainly from ON RRP balances, and seeks to reduce reserves from \"abundant\" to \"ample.\" However, reserves have remained unchanged since QT began. The article highlights that the ON RRP rate is linked to the lower bound of the federal funds rate range, initially increased by the Fed in June 2021 due to market conditions. The recent trimming of the ON RRP rate aligns it once again with the lower boundary of the target range, aiming for low or negligible ON RRP balances as QT progresses."

He emphasizes that while there has been some relief in inflation due to deflation in durable goods, this trend shows signs of ending, necessitating the continuation of restrictive monetary policies to address persistent inflationary pressures. Powell underscores the caution needed in interpreting inflation data, emphasizing the importance of long-term trends over short-term fluctuations, as demonstrated by the deceleration of the PCE price index in November. Despite a consistent downward trend in inflation, restrictive policies remain essential. The section \"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell noted the persistence of inflation in the services sector\" highlights the stabilization of durable goods prices, which decelerated past inflation but now contribute to the acceleration of core and overall PCE price indexes. The section \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET: \" shows durable goods inflation hovering at -0.4%, while core services inflation remains elevated with no substantial moderation. Regarding food and energy prices, food inflation sees a moderate acceleration resulting in the highest year-over-year increase since March, impacting the overall PCE. Meanwhile, energy prices, previously a factor in reducing inflation, show volatility and a potential end to their deceleration contributions. Overall, the Federal Reserve's cautious, long-term-focused approach aims for sustained reduction in inflationary pressures."

US Population Surges to 340 Million\" on Wolf Street, by Wolf Richter, discusses the significant upward revision of the US population by the Census Bureau, which reported an increase of 8 million over the past three years, largely driven by immigration, pushing the population to 340 million. This revision will impact economic metrics, particularly employment numbers, as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) plans to adjust its total employment figures upwards by early 2025 to align with the revised estimates. The section \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET\" elaborates that the updated figures stem from a more accurate measurement of immigration from 2021 to 2024, addressing previously underestimated immigrant numbers that clouded policymakers' understanding of labor supply and employment. The dramatic rise in immigration, marked as the largest population increase in decades, particularly in 2024, is due to improved methodology in capturing international migration data. The section titled \"Coming Up-Revisions of Total Employment & Labor Force\" explains that the BLS is set to incorporate these updated population data into employment figures, resulting in substantial revisions in labor force, total employment, and unemployment metrics. These will account for the new immigrant workers seeking jobs, irrespective of their legal status, while re-aligning household survey-based employment figures with those from nonfarm payrolls to correct discrepancies caused by the exclusion of self-employed and farm workers in the latter."

The \"Buyers\u2019 strike leads to lowest annual sales since 1995\" section describes how annual sales in 2024 are projected at only 4.04 million, the lowest since 1995, due to high home prices and mortgage rates returning to traditional levels of 6-7%. The segment \"Getting used to 6% to 7% mortgage rates\" discusses the real estate industry's acceptance of these rates as a new normal and the improbability of returning to the historically low pandemic-era rates. Further, the \"Highest supply for any November since 2018\" and \"Days on the market keep rising\" sections highlight that November saw a 3.8-month supply of unsold homes, the highest since 2018, and the longest median days spent on the market since 2019. The \"Prices are way too high\" section notes that while the median price of single-family homes edged down to $410,900 in November, reflecting seasonal trends, overall prices have surged by nearly 50% since mid-2019, presenting a challenge. Regional differences in demand are outlined in \"Demand destruction by region,\" with robust sales rates in the Southern US at 1,870,000 homes, slight increases in the Northeastern and Midwestern US, and unchanged stability in the Western US at 770,000 homes.

The Fed now projects only two cuts in 2025 as it anticipates increased inflation and higher long-term rates. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) implemented this policy move, noting only one dissenting voice from Beth M. Hammack. They also lowered the Overnight Reverse Repos offering rate, pushing money market funds towards other placements and extending the Fed's Quantitative Tightening (QT) process. The FOMC summarized revised economic projections, setting the target for the federal funds rate at 3.875% by the end of 2025. Diverse views among FOMC members forecast between no cuts to five potential cuts, reflecting a range of economic outlooks. The committee emphasized ongoing economic expansion, modest inflation progress, and its commitment to employment and inflation goals.

        "summary": "In the second half of the year, US retail sales experienced a sharp acceleration, highlighting robust consumer demand, which could potentially challenge the Federal Reserve's efforts to control inflation. Retail sales in November increased by 0.7% from October, reaching $720 billion, with a three-month average growth rate of 0.7%, resulting in an annualized growth rate of 8.6%. Several factors underpin this surge, including wage increases surpassing inflation, strong financial conditions like low debt burdens and substantial cash reserves, and a growing population due to immigration. The category breakdown reveals that vehicle sales and ecommerce drive much of this growth, contributing to 36% of total sales, with year-over-year increases of 6.5% for vehicle sales and 9.8% for ecommerce. However, food services, drinking places, and food and beverage stores observed modest yearly growth of 1.9% and 1.8%, respectively. General merchandise stores like Walmart showed a steady 3.4% year-over-year increase, whereas gas station sales declined by 3.9% due to falling gasoline prices. After a post-pandemic decline, sectors like building materials and garden supply saw a recovery with a 5.8% increase, while health and personal care stores and clothing and accessory stores recorded 2.2% growth. This dynamic retail landscape highlights the importance of careful monitoring by the Federal Reserve to manage demand without worsening inflation."

This downtrend is indicative of broader economic challenges and the cyclical nature of employment in this sector, heavily influenced by fluctuations in the housing market and lending practices. Between June 2021 and June 2024, nonbank mortgage lenders faced decreased mortgage originations, driven in part by automation, which reduced the need for human labor. Nonbank lenders like Rocket Mortgage and United Wholesale Mortgage now lead the market over traditional banks and credit unions. Employment in mortgage brokering also experienced a steep decline, with a 32% reduction by October 2024, mirroring the first housing bust. Despite these job losses, the overall impact on the US labor market remains minimal. The article also mentions a drastic drop in mortgage application activity, with refinance applications down by 70% from 2019 and 81% from 2022, alongside a 40% decline in home purchase applications from 2019 and a 48% drop from 2021. These trends underscore the volatility in the market following post-bubble corrections, as mortgage rates and the broader macroeconomic environment significantly influence the housing market's dynamics."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article \"Treasury Yield Curve Un-Inverts Further on Surging Longer-Term Yields: 10-Year Yield Now Higher than All Shorter Yields. Mortgage Rates Resurge\" by Wolf Richter discusses recent developments in the bond market and their implications. Since last September, despite the Federal Reserve's 75-basis-point rate cut, the 10-year Treasury yield has risen by the same amount to 4.40%, driven by concerns over inflationary pressures and an increase in government bond supply. This has led to an \"un-inversion\" of the yield curve, with 10-year yields now surpassing shorter-term yields, although full normalization is yet to occur. The 30-year Treasury yield also surged to 4.61%, influenced by similar factors, including anticipated new debt issuance to cover deficits, even as the Fed tightens the economic flow. Additionally, the 2-year Treasury yield increased by 66 basis points to 4.25% since September due to market adjustments to inflation expectations and fiscal policy changes. In the \"The 'yield curve' in the process of un-inverting\" section, the author explains that while the yield curve, inverted since July 2022 due to higher policy rates, shows signs of returning to a more typical relationship, it remains slightly above normalization. Mortgage rates have re-risen as well, detailed in the \"Mortgage rates have re-risen\" section, with the average 30-year fixed rate reaching 6.95%, a consequence of the increased spread as the 10-year Treasury yield rises. This unexpected rise in mortgage rates has surprised the housing industry, which, already challenged by high pandemic-era home prices, faces the lowest demand for existing homes since 1995. Developers are now working to sell an inventory of unsold homes that is the largest since 2009, indicating that rate cuts have yet to effectively stimulate the housing market."

        "summary": "In a recent Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter, it was observed that the management of Americans' cash has significantly shifted in response to fluctuating interest rates and economic conditions. In the Money Market Funds section, it was highlighted that households have increasingly turned towards money market funds, with an increase of $167 billion in the third quarter, raising total holdings to $4.11 trillion even as yields fell due to Federal Reserve rate cuts. Total money market fund balances, including institutional holdings, saw a substantial increase of $291 billion to $6.84 trillion. Meanwhile, the Large Certificates of Deposit section described that large time deposits (CDs of $100,000 or more) maintained their high levels after a 67% surge since March 2022, although their growth has since plateaued. In the Small Certificates of Deposit section, small time deposits (CDs below $100,000) experienced a noticeable decline in response to the rate cuts, reflecting their sensitivity to interest rate changes. Finally, the Total Deposits section reported an increase in total deposits at commercial banks to $17.9 trillion by November, recovering a significant amount of the $1 trillion decrease that occurred between March 2022 and May 2023 due to the collapse or shutdown of several banks, including Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic. As banks strive to compete with rising money market fund yields, they have resorted to offering higher interest rates on CDs and savings accounts to retain and attract deposits, a measure that has proven costly for banks. These dynamics underscore how Americans are adapting their savings strategies in a volatile economic environment."

The ECB is stepping away from bond market interventions and has decided to accelerate its bond QT program by allowing bonds to mature without replacement, starting after December 17. This move marks a shift from the ECB\u2019s previous quantitative easing programs, the \"Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme\" (PEPP) and the \"Asset Purchase Programme\" (APP), which focused on government securities. The ECB\u2019s strategy contrasts with the U.S. Federal Reserve's approach, which maintains caps to slow its QT process. The ECB started its QT in late 2022 by changing loan terms, leading banks to repay nearly all \u20ac2.22 trillion in loans. As bond QT progresses, the ECB's balance sheet has diminished, and its total assets have shrunk significantly, reflecting a broader trend among major central banks towards pre-pandemic monetary policies. Simultaneously, the ECB continues to cut interest rates amid slower economic growth, indicating a shift in focus to monitoring financial stability and inflation dynamics."

The section titled \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET\" highlights that existing home demand is at its lowest since 1995, leading to increased listings and incentives by builders to attract buyers, against rising mortgage rates. In \"Price declines from prior month,\" it\u2019s noted that in November, all 33 large metropolitan areas experienced price declines compared to October, with Austin seeing the largest month-over-month decrease of 1.1%. The section \"Down from their 2022 peaks\" discusses that home prices in 19 of these metropolitan areas have fallen from their 2022 peaks, with Austin down 22% and significant declines seen in San Francisco, Phoenix, San Antonio, and Denver. According to \"No New Highs in November,\" none of the areas recorded new price highs, signaling a reversal in upward trends, even affecting persistent areas like New York City's metro area. \"The 30 Most Splendid Housing Bubbles in America\" section examines significant housing bubbles using Zillow Home Value Index data, noting shifts post-2022 due to policy and mortgage rate changes. The article also reflects on how these economic and policy changes are affecting real estate trends across U.S. metropolitan statistical areas, with Austin experiencing the most significant drop from its peak by 22%, while emphasizing the need to reassess market conditions as housing dynamics evolve. Noteworthy is the long-term growth since 2000 in areas like San Jose and Miami, which have seen home price increases of over 300%."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter discusses the stronger-than-expected inflation in the Producer Price Index (PPI) due to major upward revisions going back months, particularly for services, which account for 67% of the PPI. These revisions highlight rising costs, with the overall PPI for final demand increasing by 3.0% year-over-year as of November, marking the fastest rise since February 2023. The Core PPI section shows the inflationary impact in the service sector was understated in previous reports, with significant upward revisions from September through November 2024, outpacing other sectors. In the Core Services PPI section, it is noted that this has led to visible adjustments in monthly and yearly data throughout 2024. Meanwhile, the Core Goods PPI section reveals that the PPI for \"finished core goods,\" which excludes food and energy, saw minor revisions, with a 2.5% year-over-year rise in November. Though initially stable, the deceleration in core goods inflation has ceased, contributing to an overall inflationary environment, challenging previous assessments and potentially affecting economic policy, business, and consumer decisions."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter provides a comprehensive analysis of the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, highlighting a continued acceleration in both headline and \"Core\" CPI month-to-month, as well as a rise in year-over-year figures for the second consecutive month. Key components such as motor vehicle prices, food, and gasoline have driven this increase, while housing-related inflation has shown deceleration. November saw the CPI rise by 0.31% from October, with an annualized rate of 3.8%, and the year-over-year increase was 2.75%. The Core CPI, excluding food and energy, rose by 3.32% year-over-year. Core Services CPI increased by 4.58%, although a notable decline in Durable Goods CPI was recorded at 2.01%. The \"Core Services\" component experienced a deceleration with a 3.4% annualized increase, leading to a 3-month average reduction to 4.0%, with the longer-term 6-month figure increasing to 3.7%. In \"The housing components of core services,\" the Owners' Equivalent of Rent (OER) CPI decelerated to 2.8% annualized in November, and the Rent of Primary Residence CPI also decreased. Moreover, the article highlights different behavior in asking rents and actual rent prices, with the Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI) showing larger increases compared to the CPI rent since 2017. The \"Durable goods\" section notes a stabilization or rebound in prices, particularly for new and used vehicles, while information technology products still faced declines. \"Food Inflation\" surged for \"Food at home\" with a year-over-year increase of 1.6%, driven by specific items such as eggs, beef, and veal. The \"Apparel and footwear\" section reported a modest month-to-month and year-over-year increase by 1.1%. Finally, in the \"Energy\" section, the CPI showed a minor monthly rise but an annual decline, notably with gasoline 8.1% lower year-over-year and 32% since the summer of 2021 peak, contributing to the overall inflationary trends despite a recent uptick."

Initially met with enthusiasm by Wall Street, GM's ambition faced substantial setbacks, leading to $10 billion in losses. Technological and regulatory challenges prompted GM to shut down the venture, marking a setback in its autonomous driving goals. Richter explains that GM's restructuring aims to incorporate Cruise's technical team into personal vehicle autonomous and assisted driving projects, hoping to cut spending by over $1 billion annually. Following this decision, GM's shares initially rose but later declined in after-hours trading. The venture faced severe setbacks this year, notably a pedestrian accident caused by a human driver and a Cruise vehicle, which led to regulatory issues, vehicle recalls, layoffs, and a leadership overhaul. Cruise admitted to concealing the incident, resulting in criminal charges and a DOJ settlement. Despite the industry's potential, minor accidents attract significant scrutiny, as seen with Waymo's continued success contrasted by Cruise's decline. GM CEO Mary Barra highlighted the complexities of the robotaxi business, emphasizing challenges beyond deploying technology."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter, titled \"Credit-Market Mania Crushed 'Yield Spreads' & Risk Premiums, but Corporate & CRE Borrowing Costs Are Still Much Higher,\" explores the dynamics of the current financial environment in the credit markets. Despite the perception of eased financial conditions since 2023, reminiscent of 2021's loose policies with near-zero Federal Reserve rates and aggressive quantitative easing, corporate and commercial real estate borrowing costs remain elevated. This paradox is driven by narrow yield spreads as observed in indices like the Chicago Fed\u2019s National Financial Conditions Index and the St. Louis Fed Financial Stress Index, which do not translate to reduced borrowing costs. In the corporate credit space, the article highlights the scene of junk-rated securities, notably leveraged loans and junk bonds. Leveraged loans, now based mostly on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) that replaced LIBOR, have total rates of about 8.35%, a sharp rise from 2021, yet see strong investor demand for the higher risk and limited yield. Junk bonds, typically fixed-rate, have also seen renewed issuance due to investor interest, with BB-rated corporate bonds yielding 5.71%, indicating doubled rates from 2021 lows, though down from their peak last October. The yield spread with Treasury equivalents has narrowed, spurring a surge in issuance alongside leveraged loans. This narrowing, coupled with high issuance, signals a euphoric credit market atmosphere despite prevailing higher rates, underscoring the complexities and challenges in today's borrowing landscape where risk premiums may have been reduced but actual borrowing costs remain significant."

        "summary": "The article, \"Used-Vehicle Prices Turn into Inflation Headwind,\" by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street, explores the recent rise in used-vehicle prices due to supply constraints and strong demand, reversing the inflationary benefits seen during a prior two-year price decline. Auction prices increased by 1.3% in November from October according to the Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index, marking the first year-over-year price rise since August 2022 and impacting inflation by adding new pressure as previously falling prices had eased core inflation. Discussed in the section \"The Used-Vehicle Pipeline is Messed Up, and Will Be for Years,\" the market faces ongoing disruptions, including reduced lease maturities impacting the availability of two to three-year-old vehicles, and a semiconductor shortage that resulted in 10 million fewer new vehicle sales from 2021 to 2023, constraining future used vehicle supply. Despite a 15% year-over-year increase in sales in November, retail inventories remain tight. In \"Powerful Inflation Tailwind Turned into Headwind,\" the article notes a previous 28% drop in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for used vehicles from 2022 to mid-2024, previously helping to cool core CPI. However, with a recent 2.7% CPI rise in October reducing the year-over-year decline to 3.4%, rising used vehicle prices are now exerting inflationary pressure, contributing to an acceleration in metrics like the core CPI and core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index."

In \"Labor Market Doing Fine,\" it reports robust health in the labor market with average payroll gains of 173,000 over three months and wage increases, suggesting a cautious approach to rate cuts might be wise. \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET\" details November's payroll increase by 227,000, an effect of recovery from the Boeing strike and hurricane disruptions, and raises inflation concerns due to a 4.5% annualized wage rise. The unemployment rate increased slightly to 4.2% in November, despite Fed forecasts for a higher rate by end of 2024. In \"The wave of migrants and the coming revision of the Household Survey data,\" the challenges of accurately tracking employment data due to the migrant influx are noted, leading to a planned BLS revision in January to address discrepancies between household and nonfarm payroll data. The influx of immigrants has increased the unemployment rate due to a larger labor supply. Finally, \"Careful with those rate cuts!\" discusses the Fed's cautious strategy toward rate cuts due to uncertainties around the neutral rate, suggesting a wait-and-see approach to avoid overreaction and possible abrupt rate hikes if inflation re-escalates. The article emphasizes flexibility in policy as the Fed considers the strong economic indicators of GDP growth and labor market strength."

This marks a $2.07 trillion decline from the peak, shedding 43% of the pandemic-era Quantitative Easing (QE) assets. The Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), designed during recent banking turmoil, notably the Silicon Valley Bank crisis, saw a significant decrease of $39 billion in November with plans to be phased out by March 2025. Under the section QT assets by category, the Federal Reserve reduced its Treasury securities by $24 billion, achieving a total reduction of $1.46 trillion since June 2022, representing 45% of the $3.27 trillion added during the pandemic. Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) holdings decreased by $17 billion to $2.25 trillion, a 36% reduction from their peak. The Bank liquidity facilities section explains the significant decline in usage of liquidity programs such as the BTFP and a modest $2.4 billion increase in the Discount Window. Market-based borrowing rate discrepancies initially fueled BTFP usage, but the Fed's rate revisions and closure plans aim to phase it out by 2025. The Discount Window, favored by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, faces interest costs but aims to eliminate usage stigma. Finally, What else caused total assets on the balance sheet to drop? notes reductions in Treasury securities, MBS, BTFP borrowings, and the narrowing of \"Other assets\" and \"Unamortized premiums,\" contributing to the balance sheet's $98 billion shrinkage in November, with ongoing adjustments reflecting interest accruals and bond premium depreciation."

        "summary": "In the Wolf Street article \"Everybody Should Get Used to these Mortgage Rates, Says Fannie Mae CEO: Mortgage Rates, 10-Year Treasury Yields, QT, and Spreads\" by Wolf Richter, Priscilla Almodovar, CEO of Fannie Mae, highlights that the current mortgage rates echo historical averages from decades past, and the public should adapt to these levels. This normalization follows the pandemic era of astoundingly low rates, which were a result of specific monetary policies and economic circumstances. Fannie Mae's projections for 2025 suggest that rates will likely stabilize around these historical norms, implying future fluctuations will remain within this range. Additionally, mortgage rates are intricately linked to the yields on 10-year Treasury notes, which have been rising due to Federal Reserve measures such as Quantitative Tightening (QT) and interest rate hikes aimed at controlling inflation. The widening spread between mortgage rates and Treasury yields represents the economic environment and financial market expectations adjusting to a typical rate landscape. As the mortgage market realigns, borrowers should expect higher rates compared to the recent past, yet these align with traditional levels seen historically. It's crucial for individuals and institutions to factor these normalizing conditions into their planning and adjust financial strategies accordingly. Almodovar notes that the era of extremely low interest rates has concluded, bringing notable implications for the housing market and broader economy. Historically, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage hovered around 6% since 1990, only dropping below 5% after Federal Reserve interventions during financial crises. The pandemic saw dramatic dips below 3% because of aggressive quantitative easing, which ceased when the Fed stopped buying mortgage-backed securities and embarked on QT, causing rates to surge above 6% since September 2022. She explains that despite the fundamental connection between mortgage rates and the 10-year Treasury yield, mortgage investments entail additional risks, thus the persistent spread can remain wide, keeping upward pressure on mortgage rates."

        "summary": "The article \"Cut the Price and They Will Come: New-Vehicle Sales Jump amid Big Discounts and Incentives, as Inventory Balloons\" on Wolf Street by Wolf Richter discusses the current surge in U.S. new-vehicle sales driven by large discounts and incentives offered by dealerships to attract customers amid growing inventory levels. Despite these incentives boosting sales, prices remain high and have not been reduced to fully reflect the increased supply. In \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET,\" it is noted that in November, new-vehicle sales increased by 10% year-over-year to 1.40 million, with retail sales also up 10% to 1.15 million units, achieving the highest annual sales rate since May 2021. This improvement in sales reflects a recovery in inventories and competitive price-cutting strategies by automakers, although long-term unit sales have stagnated over the past 25 years, with brands like Tesla and Hyundai-Kia gaining market share. \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET\" also highlights that automakers like Ford and Stellantis have implemented aggressive incentives to boost sales of overstocked models, leading to reduced prices. Inventory levels have spiked due to prior high prices, prompting Ford to report a 14% sales increase and introduce a new pricing strategy for its 2025 F-series, while Stellantis increased incentives based on dealer feedback to manage excess inventory. Despite greater incentives and inventory numbers, transaction prices and profitability are anticipated to moderate, with the Consumer Price Index for new vehicles gradually declining, suggesting slow affordability improvements in the market. These developments are expected to maintain sales momentum as prices stabilize, potentially returning to pre-pandemic sales figures."

The Fed Is Already Backpedaling on the Pace and Depth of Rate Cuts\" from Wolf Street highlights a significant upswing in the labor market, as evidenced by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS). October saw a marked increase in job openings and voluntary quits, reflecting worker confidence and available opportunities, alongside a substantial decrease in layoffs. These trends indicate a strengthening labor market, contrasting with earlier circumstances affected by the Boeing strike and hurricanes, which had temporarily skewed job data. Job openings have surpassed pre-pandemic levels, and the ratio of openings to unemployed persons suggests robust labor demand. However, hiring experienced a slight dip, calling for cautious optimism. These dynamics have prompted the Federal Reserve to reconsider its aggressive strategy for interest rate cuts, as the empirical data points to a healthier labor market than previously perceived. The significant jump in voluntary quits indicates renewed confidence among workers and potential labor force mobility, possibly leading to a re-heating of the market. Overall, the decreasing layoffs show stability as employers retain their workforce, urging the Fed, under Jerome Powell's leadership, to take a balanced approach to support employment gains while avoiding economic overheating."

The section \"Factory Construction Spending Soars to New Record\" highlights a 16% year-over-year increase and a 242% rise since 2019, driven by corporate shifts and incentives under Trump's tariffs and Biden's taxpayer-funded policies promoting domestic manufacturing. In \"Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET,\" manufacturing plant investments reached a record $21.1 billion in October, with a focus on automated facilities for high-value goods like semiconductors, supported by the CHIPS Act's substantial funding. The cost of setting up such plants exceeds construction expenses, indicating rapid expansion with projected $234 billion spending by 2024. In \"The Big Rethink,\" Biden's debt-funded incentives have fueled investments, especially in states like Texas and Arizona, though these could phase out if Trump reinstates tariffs. Companies are rethinking dependencies on China due to strained relations and pandemic disruptions, aligning with Trump's China-hawk stance which Biden largely maintains. \"Factories become a bigger part of overall construction spending\" reports that factory construction's share of total spending almost doubled since 2019, pointing to a shift without construction cost inflation. \"The first money of the CHIPS Act starts flowing in December\" reveals that Intel, as a key beneficiary, starts receiving funds, marking the initial disbursement under the Act. Lastly, in \"Industrial robots cost the same anywhere,\" the article emphasizes that the uniform cost of industrial robots supports U.S. manufacturing of complex products like vehicles and semiconductors, minimizing labor costs and focusing on high-value production over manual labor."

The section by Wolf Richter highlights that this spike is the fastest recorded in two years, pointing to a deep depression in the office real estate sector, exacerbated by high vacancy rates and insufficient rental income. Many landlords struggle to meet mortgage obligations, leading to defaults, while the structural issue of an oversupply of old office buildings hinders refinancing efforts as these buildings fail to generate adequate income, and market prices fall. This is detailed in the section for Wolf Street, which notes that loan restructuring and term extensions have been attempted, yet these solutions only delay the problem. The article mentions efforts to convert older office spaces into residential units as a partial solution, but these represent a small fraction of available office spaces, and the vast vacancy remains largely unaddressed. Fortunately, the US banking system remains relatively insulated, as risks are widely distributed among global investors and firms, with resilience shown by the fact no banks have failed under this pressure despite some banks having high exposure. The article provides a comprehensive overview of the significant challenges within the office sector of commercial real estate."

This rise in payments, detailed in \"Interest payments have surged because\u2026,\" is due to ballooning national debt and rising interest rates, with the debt having soared by $2.1 trillion in 2024 alone to a total of $36.1 trillion, worsening the debt-to-GDP ratio to 120.8%. The article also elaborates that the fiscal imbalance has been fueled by historically low interest rates from 2008 to 2021, which led to extensive debt. While market conditions like capital gains taxes impact tax receipts and fluctuate with market performance, long-term growth in tax receipts is driven by factors like higher incomes and corporate profits, underscored by inflation which increases taxable incomes. The \"By Wolf Richter for Wolf Street\" section discusses how government interest payments increased by $37 billion year-over-year, a 15% jump to $279 billion, while tax receipts grew by $29 billion or 4.1% to $740 billion in the same period, particularly emphasizing how the market downturn in 2022 impacted tax receipts. The article cautions that without addressing this imbalance through potential legislative action or enduring higher inflation and interest rates, the financial strain on the government could continue to increase, potentially impacting the broader economy."

        "summary": "The article from Wolf Street, authored by Wolf Richter, discusses the concerning trend of inflation re-accelerating despite the decrease in gasoline prices, primarily driven by a surge in the costs of core services, which have hit a seven-month high. As the introduction mentions, this suggests persistent inflationary pressures that remain despite lower energy costs, leading the Federal Reserve to consider a more cautious stance on the pace of interest rate cuts. According to the section \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET,\" inflation is predominantly seen in the services sector, which has become persistent and is accelerating. This sector significantly influences consumer spending with notable increases in durable goods prices for the second consecutive month, although falling gasoline prices and slight food price increases have partially offset this trend. These changes are measured using the PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) price index, a critical measure for the Federal Reserve's inflation targets. The article details that several major inflation indicators, including the overall and core PCE indices, accelerated year-over-year in October, with the durable goods index trending towards less negative territory, indicating possible inflationary trends. As outlined in the section \"Core services showed significant inflation acceleration,\" core services demonstrated a 4.4% annual increase in prices in October, marking the fastest rise since May and exerting a substantial impact on overall inflation measures. This category includes areas like housing, healthcare, and transportation while excluding energy services. Lastly, as discussed in the section titled \"Inflation in durable goods...\" despite traditionally facing price reductions due to efficiencies and offshoring, durable goods have faced inflation due to pandemic-driven demand spikes and subsequent supply chain issues. The overall PCE, including volatile food and energy prices, rose 2.3% year-over-year, even with significant energy price declines. This divergence between the overall PCE and core PCE indices highlights the varying influences of housing and transportation prices on inflation trends, where energy prices affect overall but not core PCE measures."

        "summary": "In the Wolf Street article \"Inventory of New Single-Family Houses Jumps to Highest since 2007. Unsold Spec Houses Jump to Highest since 2009 as Sales Suddenly Plunge,\" author Wolf Richter discusses the challenges facing homebuilders due to a substantial rise in unsold new single-family homes, the highest since 2007, with speculative (spec) houses reaching their peak unsold inventory since 2009. The increased supply, coupled with declining sales, has industry experts suggesting potential price cuts to address the imbalance. In the section titled \"Inventory of New Single-Family Houses,\" it is highlighted that builders are producing more affordable homes and offering incentives amid decreasing demand for existing homes, which has resulted in inventory accumulation. Despite a 9.3% year-over-year increase in new home inventory and a significant 53% rise in unsold completed spec houses, builders are hopeful that price reductions will address price dislocations. \"Sales of completed houses\" in October dropped significantly, with a 25% month-to-month decline, yet new single-family house sales across all construction stages rose slightly by 3.3% year-to-date, implying selective market resilience. The \"Prices, Mortgage-Rate Buydowns, and Incentives\" section indicates fluctuating median contract prices for new homes, with a noted spike in October to $437,300, following a similar trend in 2022. This doesn't fully reflect builders' adjustments in costs, such as incentives and mortgage-rate buydowns that year. \"Prices of New Houses Versus Existing Houses\" shows new homes historically being priced higher than existing ones by 10% to 30%, with recent market dynamics involving incentive programs altering this trend, resulting in new homes gaining preference over existing homes whose sales have plummeted to 1995 levels. This shift has sustained new home sales despite the challenges."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter examines several key trends in the automotive market, highlighting how Americans are increasingly opting for larger, more powerful, and more fuel-efficient vehicles, with electric vehicles (EVs) contributing to a burgeoning \"Horsepower War.\" According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the specific power of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles has risen significantly over the past five decades, a trend that continues unabated. The section titled \"Overall Fuel Economy\" explains that the fuel economy of passenger vehicles in the US reached a record 28.0 MPG for the 2024 model year, with the \"Car SUV\" segment seeing a remarkable 47% improvement since 2019, driven largely by EVs like the Tesla Model Y. In \"The Horsepower War,\" the article notes a sharp increase in average vehicle horsepower, citing a new peak of 267 horsepower for 2024, largely due to advancements like fuel injection and electronic engine management. Electric vehicles, alongside potent electric pickup trucks such as the Ford F-150 Lightning and Tesla Cybertruck, are expected to further drive this horsepower escalation as EV market share grows, having reached 9.0% in the third quarter. \"Automakers made huge progress in ICE technology\" explores the continuous advancements in ICE efficiency, with increased specific power and reduced fuel consumption exemplified by models like the 2024 Ford Mustang. However, as section \"But Power, luxury, and fancy stuff weigh more\" reveals, this progression comes with increased vehicle weights, with the average weight reaching 4,419 pounds, particularly in pickup trucks and electric models. Lastly, \"And it costs a lot more\u2026\" delves into vehicle pricing, illustrating the divergent trends between vehicles like the Ford F-150 XLT, which has seen significant price reductions, and the Toyota Camry LE, now sold only as a hybrid with a notable price increase for its 2025 model. The article provides a comprehensive view of how consumer preferences and technological advances are reshaping the automotive landscape, emphasizing a shift toward high-performance vehicles with improved fuel efficiency."

        "summary": "In Q3 2024, the Federal Reserve reported significant operating and \"unrealized\" losses, reflecting a departure from the previous benefits of Quantitative Easing. Operating losses totaled $19.9 billion, driven by higher interest expenses outpacing income from a shrinking portfolio of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. Over the first three quarters, operating losses showed improvement at $63.1 billion, down from $88.1 billion in the previous year, projecting an annual total below $85 billion. \u201cUnrealized losses\u201d on securities reduced to $818 billion by September 30 from a mid-year peak of $1.302 trillion, although they might edge back towards $1 trillion as yields increase. These represent the gap between amortized costs and current market values, expected to close as securities mature. Since the Fed creates its own money and can't become insolvent, losses primarily impact the Treasury Department, which ceased receiving remittances. Transitioning to positive income could take several years, resuming remittances thereafter. Historically, QE yielded $1.1 trillion in remittances from 2008 to Q3 2022, but current challenges underscore the risk associated with rising rates."

The \"Debt 'Held by the public'\" section outlines that $28.69 trillion of the $36.03 trillion in Treasury securities are tradable and need continuous buyers, especially as the Federal Reserve reduces its holdings. In \"Foreign investors backed up their trucks and loaded up,\" it notes foreign investors, despite reductions from China and Japan, added $170 billion to their holdings in September, attracted by yields compared to domestic options. \"The share of Treasury bills\" reveals a record $6.19 trillion in outstanding T-bills, with growing public demand demonstrated by stability in their share and market shifts towards liquid and secure assets. \"To replenish the checking account? Nope.\" clarifies that the Treasury General Account (TGA) was not replenished in 2024 as its balance remained stable, indicating that additional government debt might have been allocated elsewhere. \"The Debt-to-GDP ratio, ugh.\" communicates that the ratio climbed to 120.8% in Q3, pointing to fiscal imbalance despite GDP growth and raising sustainability concerns. \"The burden of interest payments spiked\" highlights interest obligations consuming 36.3% of tax receipts in Q2, the highest since 1997, amid concerns on whether this trend will continue. Lastly, \"The average interest rate on this debt\" shows a decrease to 3.30% in October, marking the second consecutive monthly decline but still aligning with some of the highest rates since 2010, allowing Treasury to manage these conditions with relatively cost-efficient strategies despite the challenging debt environment."

        "summary": "The article titled \"US Dollar Crushes Euro, Yen, Canadian Dollar, other Currencies as Fed Backpedals on Pace of Rate Cuts\" by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET discusses the recent appreciation of the US dollar against major currencies like the Euro, Japanese Yen, and Canadian Dollar. This change has resulted from the Federal Reserve's revised approach to rate cuts amid persistent inflation concerns and strong economic performance. As detailed in the first section, the cautious stance on interest rate reductions has heightened the dollar's attractiveness to investors. Subsequently, the US dollar index reached a two-year high, driven by policy rate changes from central banks, as outlined in the section by Wolf Richter. The article further explains how this policy divergence, notably between the Fed and other central banks like the European Central Bank (ECB), Bank of Canada, and Bank of Japan, has widened interest rate spreads. As a result, currencies such as the Euro and Canadian Dollar have declined notably against the dollar, exacerbated by aggressive rate cuts from their central banks. In contrast, the Yen has suffered due to the Bank of Japan's less robust monetary tightening. The final section focuses on concerns regarding the broader economic implications of fluctuating currencies, as central banks navigate complex environments where interest rate strategies significantly influence currency values. While these disparities in monetary policies might bolster the US dollar's strength, they could simultaneously amplify economic challenges for trading partners with weaker currencies, thereby highlighting the interplay between monetary policy, currency valuation, and global market dynamics."

This buyers\u2019 strike continues in November and December, as mortgage applications have decreased significantly, with a 50% drop from 2019 levels. Supply is second highest for any October in 7 years, behind only 2018, with unsold inventory reaching 1.37 million homes, marking a significant 19% increase from the previous year. Days on the market rise, with homes taking an average of 58 days to sell in October. The 7% mortgages are back, with the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate surpassing 7%, impacting October's mortgage applications and, consequently, closed sales. Home prices vary widely by metro, with some areas experiencing significant fluctuations, such as Austin seeing a 20.4% drop from its peak, while New York City alone reached new highs among the largest housing market bubbles. The National Association of Realtors (NAR) blames everything except the problem: too-high prices, attributing declining demand to factors like limited inventory and rising mortgage rates, despite commercial real estate and homebuilders reducing prices and offering incentives to stimulate sales. The article concludes by highlighting demand destruction by region, noting variations across the US, with the North and Midwest seeing increased sales rates, the South showing robust demand, and the West experiencing moderate growth."

        "summary": "The article \"ECB\u2019s Own Measure of Wage Increases Blows Fuse, Sets Off Alarms about Stubbornly Hot Services Inflation\" by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street discusses the challenges faced by the European Central Bank (ECB) in managing persistently high services inflation, despite efforts to control economic variables through quantitative tightening (QT), which has successfully reduced the balance sheet by \u20ac2.45 trillion, accounting for 59% of the pandemic QE. The ECB\u2019s \"Negotiated Wages\" index, reflecting upcoming wage hikes from collective bargaining agreements, spiked by 5.4% year-over-year in Q3, contrary to expectations of wage moderation that would support disinflation and justify rate cuts. While higher wages can boost demand, they pose an inflationary risk, especially in the services sector. Services inflation, despite reduced energy prices, remains high with a CPI rate of 4.0% in October, well above the ECB's 2% target. Core CPI, excluding volatile items, has steadily risen, further complicating the ECB's task of balancing policy actions to control inflation without exacerbating it. The ECB's balance sheet, now at \u20ac6.38 trillion, reflects progress in QT, yet the option to adjust rates remains should inflation persist."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter provides a comprehensive overview of various facets of credit card trends in Q3 2024, emphasizing the current state of credit card delinquency, balances, income, and bank behavior in relation to credit. In \"Credit Card Delinquency Rates,\" the analysis reveals a decrease to 3.2% according to Federal Reserve data, with a prime delinquency rate of just 0.99% and subprime borrowers seeing recovery after previous hardships. This indicates a stable financial scenario for U.S. credit card users, especially those with higher credit scores. Under \"Subprime doesn\u2019t mean low income, it means bad credit,\" the article clarifies that subprime credit pertains to bad credit rather than low income and highlights the misreporting by some media on the New York Fed's \"Transition into Delinquency\" as an end-of-quarter delinquency rate, when it is actually an annual measure of delinquency inflow. In \"Credit Card Balances are a partial measure spending, not of debt,\" the piece discusses how credit card balances, at $1.17 trillion in Q3 after a $24 billion increase, mostly reflect consumer spending rather than debt due to practices like paying off balances in full. The section, \"Income rose 142%, credit balances only 53% in 20 years,\" points out that over two decades, disposable income has risen by 142%, while credit balances have grown by only 53%, reducing the debt-to-income ratio substantially. Finally, \"Banks are eager to expand credit\" captures how banks are actively expanding credit availability with a $269 billion increase in credit limits, driven by the opening of new accounts and limit raises, culminating in a $3.82 trillion in available unused credit, suggesting banks' aggressive push to extend credit access. The article is part of a more extensive series exploring consumer credit dynamics, including auto loans, housing debt, and household debt trends."

This robust demand, which saw a $170 billion increase in foreign holdings in September, accumulating to a record $8.67 trillion, is primarily driven by higher US Treasury yields like the 10-year yield at 4.42%, which are much more appealing than those in countries like Germany and Japan. The increase in foreign holdings to 24.5% of total Treasury debt underscores the strong global demand, with major financial centers such as London and Luxembourg accounting for a significant portion, as exhibited by their $92 billion increase in September. However, in the section Euro Area v. China + Hong Kong, it is noted that China and Hong Kong have reduced their US Treasury holdings by 0.5% in September and 5.3% over the past year, while the Euro Area significantly boosted its holdings by $99 billion in September and has experienced a 234% surge since 2012. Japan's holdings decreased slightly, influenced by the depreciating yen and limited monetary tightening. Meanwhile, the United Kingdom increased its holdings by 2.8% in September and 26.5% over the past year, with Canada's holdings more than tripling since March 2021. Taiwan and India also saw notable increases in their holdings, while Brazil's remained steady compared to 2012 levels, illustrating diverse international investment strategies in US Treasuries."

Auto-loan balances reached $1.64 trillion, a marginal increase, hinting at a low annual growth rate due to a rise in cash purchases, with 20% for new vehicles and 64% for used, as consumers cope with high-interest rates. Despite an impressive 135% surge in auto-loan balances over 20 years, primarily due to price hikes rather than unit sales increases, new vehicle prices in 2023 slightly reduced, affecting loan growth. The burden of auto loans relative to disposable income showed improvement as vehicle prices declined and incomes rose, decreasing the debt-to-income ratio to 7.5% by Q1 2024. Subprime lending, inherently risky, especially in the used vehicle sector, saw strains, amplified by falling vehicle prices and rising interest rates, forcing some dealer chains into bankruptcy. America's Car-Mart exemplified the subprime difficulties with a substantial drop in stock prices due to serious financial issues. In terms of delinquency rates, the total 60-plus day rate was at 1.55% in September, reflecting stable prime rates within 0.28% to 0.35% this year and unchanged subprime rates at 6.1%, indicating stabilization from earlier reckless lending practices. Prime delinquencies, resilient even during recessions, highlight a strong financial status, contrasting with the troubled subprime sector amid a shifting economic landscape."

In October 2024, Toronto saw a significant 19% decline in single-family home prices from peak levels, returning to October 2021 values, while cities like Montreal, Quebec City, Edmonton, and Winnipeg maintained near-record highs, highlighting regional variations. In the \"By\" section, home sales rose by 7.7% from the previous month and 30% year-over-year, while new listings fell by 3.5% and inventory increased by 11.4% year-over-year, leading to reduced supply.

In the \"Mortgage balances in Q3\" section, Richter notes a slight increase of 0.57% in mortgage balances, attributing the slowdown to potential homebuyers opting for renting due to high mortgage rates and stagnant home prices. This trend has shifted consumer preferences towards renting. In the \"HELOC balances surge\" section, Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOC) balances rose significantly, up 1.8% from Q2 and 11.9% year-over-year, driven by homeowners choosing HELOCs over refinancing due to higher mortgage rates. Despite the increase, HELOCs remain historically low as a percentage of total mortgage balances. The \"The burden of housing debt\" section reveals that housing debts increased by 0.60%, but faster growth in disposable income reduced the debt-to-income ratio to a low 59.5%, suggesting consumers face a relatively low debt burden compared to past eras. In the \"Serious delinquencies remain low\" section, serious mortgage delinquencies are at a low of 0.57%, with HELOC delinquencies at 0.36%, the lowest since 2006. Rising home prices have helped prevent widespread delinquencies, even during strong labor markets with falling home prices. Finally, the \"The frying-pan pattern of foreclosures\" section highlights that pandemic-era relief programs significantly reduced foreclosures, with Q3 2024 numbers at 41,520, much lower than pre-pandemic levels, indicating the sustained influence of these relief efforts."

The report reveals revisions for October showing an acceleration in price increases, particularly a rise in services PPI that led to a core PPI increase of 3.1% year-over-year. Though energy and food prices saw a month-to-month drop, the overall PPI rose by 2.4% year-over-year, mainly due to the increase in services PPI. It is pointed out that inflation in services has become more persistent, with the PPI for final demand services climbing to a 3.2% annualized rate in October, influenced by areas like portfolio management and airline passenger services. The consistent upward trend in service prices is further underscored by revised data from past months. On the other hand, the \"finished core goods\" PPI stayed relatively stable due to declining goods prices, with a modest rise to 1.5% annualized in October. This stability, coupled with the decrease in energy prices, has helped curb overall inflation impacts. However, the persistent rise in core PPI by 3.1% month-to-month annualized in October highlights ongoing inflationary pressures, despite energy prices aiding in moderating these trends as the overall PPI climbed sharply to 2.4%."

In the \"Household Debt\" section, it is noted that while total household debt has increased by $71 billion to $17.9 trillion, driven by higher borrowing capacity and rising costs of major purchases, incomes have also risen significantly, leading to improved debt management. In \"The relative burden of household debt\" section, the debt-to-disposable income ratio is described as historically low at 82%, reflecting stable consumer financial health compared to the pre-Financial Crisis era when consumers were over-leveraged. The \"Serious delinquencies form frying-pan pattern\" section highlights that despite a small number of individuals, termed \"Drunken Sailors,\" who struggle with credit, the overall delinquency rate for household debts beyond 90 days is at a historic low of 1.8%. \"Foreclosures from frying-pan pattern\" reveals a decline in foreclosures, down to 41,520 in Q3, thanks to higher home prices which allow debt-burdened homeowners to clear debts through sales, avoiding negative credit impact unless there is a sharp drop in home prices and high unemployment. In the \"Third-party collections not even in a frying-pan pattern\" section, it is observed that the percentage of consumers with third-party collections has reached a record low of 4.60%. Lastly, the \"Consumers with bankruptcies form frying-pan pattern\" section notes a significant decrease in bankruptcy filings to 126,140 in Q3, suggesting a minimal risk of sudden increases in financial distress.

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter analyzes the reacceleration of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and core CPI, which excludes food and energy, indicating persistent inflationary pressures in the economy. The \"Year-over-year, CPI and core CPI accelerated\" section reports an overall CPI increase of 2.6%, despite falling gasoline prices, with core CPI accelerating to 3.3% over the third consecutive month. In \"Core services\" CPI, a slight deceleration in October contrasts with a minor acceleration in the 3-month annualized rate. Meanwhile, \"The housing components of core services\" highlights a significant rise in the Owners' Equivalent of Rent to 4.9% in October. The \"Durable goods\" section explains how used vehicle prices unexpectedly rose, disrupting a cooling trend in core CPI, while new vehicle prices remained stable despite inventory surpluses. \"Food Inflation\" notes a stabilization yet high level of food inflation for groceries, with a 26% rise since January 2020, showing varied trends across food categories. In \"Apparel and footwear,\" there was an October decline in CPI, marking stability year-over-year. The \"Energy\" section discusses the flat CPI due to a 0.9% decrease in gasoline prices, with divergent trends across different energy categories, influencing consumer expenses. This comprehensive overview of each economic sector illustrates the current inflationary environment and the factors contributing to these shifts."

Only New York City Ekes Out New High\" for Wolf Street, significant home price declines are reported in 29 of the 30 largest US metro areas, with only New York City hitting a new peak. The article is divided into sections titled \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET\" and \"The 30 Most Splendid Housing Bubbles in America.\" It starts by discussing low demand and high supply in the housing market, magnified by elevated mortgage rates despite a rate cut, around 7%, deterring buyers. Homebuilders have gained market share by reducing prices and offering incentives, making renting more attractive. This reduced demand leads to price drops in major cities, with declines from 2022 peaks in 19 out of 30 metropolitan areas, indicating a shift in housing dynamics. The section \"The 30 Most Splendid Housing Bubbles in America\" analyzes Zillow's Home Value Index data, noting that significant price shifts arose from changes in federal monetary policy and mortgage rates since 2022. It focuses on metros with peak home values above $300,000, identifying key markets like Austin, San Francisco, Phoenix, and San Antonio as experiencing notable declines. Austin faces the steepest drop at 20.4%. The section underscores variability in housing price trends due to Federal Reserve policy shifts, showing these bubbles' volatility with recent regional downturns despite past rapid gains."

There Were Some Twists\" by Wolf Richter analyzes recent shifts in pricing strategies by major automakers Ford and Toyota. The article highlights how Ford has cut the MSRP of its 2025 F-150 XLT trucks, marking a rare reduction following years of significant increases, with the base model's price reduced by over $2,000. However, this only partially compensates for the previous cumulative 35% price hikes over the past three years. On the other hand, Toyota has discontinued the base Camry LE model in favor of the Camry LE Hybrid as the new entry-level option, effectively raising the base price by nearly $2,000. These changes occur amidst a general decline in new vehicle prices over the past year, driven by accumulated inventories and consumer resistance. Both automakers' pricing adjustments mirror broader trends in the industry towards fuel efficiency and affordability. The discussion also touches on the challenges faced by the long-term data in the Wolf Street price index as these shifts alter the model structures and features, and despite actual prices paid by consumers often differing from the MSRP, it remains a consistent measure for tracking historical vehicle pricing trends. The article underscores the automotive industry's need to adapt pricing strategies in response to market dynamics and the consumer price index for new vehicles."

        "summary": "The article \"We May Not Get Our Recession until the AI Spending Bubble Implodes\" by Wolf Richter on WOLF STREET explores the possibility that the anticipated recession might be delayed until the current AI spending bubble collapses, which could take years. It highlights that corporate balance sheets and cash flows are channeling substantial money into the economy through significant investment in AI, acting as a stimulant that may postpone recessionary pressures. The article draws parallels with the Dotcom Bubble, noting that the present wave of AI investment, involving major corporations such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Tesla, is boosting economic activity. This involves AI-related spending categorized into operational expenses that lower earnings, and capital expenditures like AI servers that impact future earnings. Smaller companies, utilities, and startups are also contributing to this economic surge. However, the article warns that when AI investments inevitably slow, akin to the Dotcom Bust, it could lead to job losses and reduced spending, potentially causing a recession. This economic pattern suggests that while aggressive corporate spending during the AI surge is fostering vibrant economic activity, it poses risks if spending decreases, potentially causing far-reaching effects on the economy similarly to those witnessed after the Dotcom era."

        "summary": "The article \"With Home Prices Way Too High, More People Profit from Arbitraging Vast Cost Difference between Renting and Buying\" by Wolf Richter from Wolf Street discusses how the high costs associated with homeownership are encouraging more people to rent. The section titled \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET\" reveals that Fannie Mae\u2019s National Housing Survey shows a record-high preference for renting over buying at 36%, surpassing levels seen during the 2010-2011 housing bust. This shift is largely due to soaring home prices since 2020, which make buying a home less affordable monthly compared to renting. The section \"The cost of buying a home significantly...\" highlights how additional financial burdens such as mortgage rates, property taxes, and insurance premiums make homeownership costlier than renting. This realization of financial disadvantage has led to a notable decline in home-buying demand, akin to levels last seen in 1995, while inventories of homes have begun to increase. Lastly, the section \"Renting provides more financial flexibility...\" explains that renting offers more flexibility and minimizes the risk of loss from potential declines in property values, seen in some markets. Many are choosing to rent to avoid the hefty expenses of homeownership and possible home value depreciation, especially in light of economic challenges like Quantitative Tightening, which maintains high mortgage rates."

        "summary": "The article from Wolf Street, authored by Wolf Richter, discusses the Federal Reserve's Quantitative Tightening (QT) program, highlighting a significant reduction in the Fed's balance sheet to $6.99 trillion as of October 2023. This represents a contraction of $1.97 trillion since its peak, effectively reversing 41% of the asset expansion that occurred during the pandemic's Quantitative Easing (QE). The article delves into the \"QT assets by category,\" noting a $24 billion decrease in Treasury securities to $4.34 trillion, marking a reduction of 44% of the pandemic-era additions. The roll-off of these securities, mainly Treasury notes and bonds, has a monthly cap of $25 billion and is slightly adjusted by inflation protections on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). Moreover, the Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) portfolio decreased by $16 billion to $2.27 trillion, a 35% rollback of the pandemic QE additions, largely due to mortgage payoffs amid declining home sales and refinancing. The Federal Reserve is contemplating outright sales of agency MBS to accelerate reductions. In the section about \"Bank liquidity facilities,\" the article indicates that the Discount Window's balance remained at $1.6 billion in October 2023, significantly down from its peak of $153 billion during the March 2023 bank panic. The stigma and cost associated with the Discount Window limit its usage despite Chairman Jerome Powell's encouragement. Meanwhile, the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) reduced its balance to $56 billion, the lowest since its peak of $168 billion when banks initially exploited it for arbitrage. The Federal Reserve closed this arbitrage loophole in January 2024 and plans to let the BTFP expire by March 2024, targeting full liquidation by March 2025."

        "summary": "The article \"Fed Cuts by 25 Basis Points, to 4.75% Top of Range, as Telegraphed to Backpedal from Monster Cut. QT Continues\" on Wolf Street highlights the Federal Reserve's decision to reduce interest rates by 25 basis points, setting the top range at 4.75%. This move, covered in the section by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET, reflects prior signals from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) about a modest rate cut as opposed to a larger reduction. The Fed's decision follows feedback from revised economic indicators such as GDP and inflation, alongside impacts from the October jobs report, which were influenced temporarily by strikes and natural disasters. The section \"What changed in the FOMC\u2019s statement\" notes the FOMC's statement now perceiving inflation and employment risks as balanced, a shift from the prior stance. This section also emphasizes the continued growth of economic activity, slight easing of labor market conditions, and an unemployment rate that remains low despite slight increases. The Committee reduced the federal funds rate target to 4.5%-4.75%, a more modest decrease than initially implemented, highlighting their cautious approach to adjusting rates based on incoming data. The Fed continues its quantitative tightening process by reducing its assets in Treasury securities and maintains the dual mandate goals of maximizing employment and achieving a 2% inflation target, as stated during a \"no-dot-plot\" meeting where detailed economic projections were not disclosed. These strategic moves reflect the Committee's nuanced outlook and future policy adjustments to sustain economic stability."

Treasury yields, particularly the 10-year, rose to 4.46%, up by 81 basis points since a mid-September Federal Reserve rate cut. This increase, alongside rises in the 30-year and 2-year yields, has caused the yield curve to un-invert after being inverted since 2022, as longer-term yields surpass short-term ones. Consequently, mortgage rates linked to the 10-year yield have risen to 7.13%, leading to reduced mortgage applications and decreased demand for homes, thereby exacerbating challenges within the struggling housing market. These developments have spooked the bond market, creating financial losses for bondholders due to plunging bond prices and increased nervousness and volatility. Despite initial expectations of falling rates, the current trajectory raises concerns about further challenges for homebuyers and sellers, impacting housing affordability and financial stability."

Under the section titled \"Median Days on the Market drag out,\" it notes that the typical time a listing spends on the market has increased to 61 days, suggesting that sellers, realizing the challenging market conditions, are either adjusting prices downwards or leaving properties unsold for longer durations. In \"Inventories are piling up because prices are too high.

Prices must become more realistic to allow market movement. \"Price reductions trim too-high listing price\" notes a significant number of price reductions, the third-highest since 2016, signaling that more considerable cuts are necessary to spark interest in an oversupplied market. The major Texas markets are experiencing varied degrees of price declines in closed sales prices, with Austin seeing a 20% drop from its June 2022 peak, Dallas-Fort Worth down 4.4%, Houston down 1.9% from its peak but still gaining year-over-year, and San Antonio experiencing a 6.8% dip from its peak, all reflecting the ongoing challenges in the housing market as sellers grapple with a mismatch between buyer expectations and existing price points."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article titled \"Social Security Update Fiscal 2024: Trust Fund, Income, Outgo, and Deficit\" by Wolf Richter examines the current status of the Social Security Trust Fund, formally known as the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund (OASI), amidst its fiscal 2024 performance. The social security contributions rose by 5.6% due to higher employment and wages, and taxation of benefits increased by $3 billion, resulting in a record income of $1.21 trillion. However, this income growth was outpaced by an 8.5% increase in expenses, which reached $1.30 trillion, primarily due to rising benefit payments driven by more retirees and cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs). This led to the Trust Fund facing a $91.5 billion deficit, marking its largest shortfall to date after successive annual deficits since 2018, which decreased its balance to $2.58 trillion. The section on \"How the Trust Fund invested the $2.58 trillion\" explains that these assets are conservatively placed in special-issue Treasury securities preventing market volatility-induced losses. The \"Fed\u2019s interest rate repression contributed to the deficit\" section further explains how low interest rates negatively impacted earnings, which in 2024 were $63 billion compared to a potential $107 billion if rates had stayed at 4.5%. As these low-yield securities mature, the average interest rate rose to 2.52%, with better rates anticipated as the 10-year yield is now at 4.3%. Meanwhile, the \"Shifting to shorter-term securities\" section discusses the decrease in average maturity periods to 5.19 years, aligning with the SSA's strategy to benefit from future high-yield securities soon. The \"Tweaking the plan is necessary\" section argues that despite the Trust Fund's deficit, equivalent actions can still stabilize the system without drastic consequences. Failure to act could result in the fund depleting within a decade, possibly necessitating legislative changes or budgetary supplements. Although prior Congressional proposals to resolve these issues have stagnated, minor adjustments have previously proven sufficient to address financial pressures effectively."

        "summary": "The article \"Office CMBS Delinquency Rate Spikes to 9.4%, Highest Since Worst Months after the Financial Crisis\" by Wolf Richter on Wolf Street highlights the severe challenges facing commercial real estate (CRE) in the office sector. The delinquency rate for Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (CMBS) has surged to 9.4%, a level not seen since the aftermath of the financial crisis. This increase points to heightened distress driven by remote work trends and urban dynamics. As a result, the industry is cautiously adopting a \"survive till 2025\" outlook, hoping for stabilization despite deep uncertainties about market recovery. Over the past two years, some older office buildings have lost up to 70% of their value as landlords struggle to collect sufficient rent to cover loan interest, exacerbating mortgage delinquencies. Refinancing maturing loans remains a challenge, contributing to the spike in delinquency rates. Although there are rumors about the market bottoming out, the continuous rise in CMBS delinquencies suggests deeper structural issues, such as vacancy rates ranging from 25% to 36% in major markets, often due to overbuilding and changing work habits. Delinquent office buildings, where interest payments are overdue after a 30-day grace period, typically result in significant losses for CMBS holders. The CRE industry hopes for interest rate cuts to ease floating-rate loan payments, aiding a \"survive till 2025\" strategy. Nonetheless, this does not resolve core challenges of declining demand and overvaluation of mostly vacant office towers, many of which were refinanced at inflated valuations pre-pandemic, now posing issues for lenders and investors."

Under \"Ditching Stocks,\" Berkshire significantly reduced its stock holdings by net selling $34.6 billion worth of stocks, including a substantial sale of Apple shares, paring down its stake from 908 million shares two years ago to about 300 million shares, while also reducing its Bank of America shares. Despite these reductions, Apple remains its largest investment, valued at $69.9 billion. The \"Ditching Bonds\" section reveals Berkshire decreased its bond holdings by about 33%, including a major reduction in U.S. Treasury and government bonds, with much of these funds reinvested in U.S. Treasury bills. The \"Ditching Share Buybacks\" part explains that Berkshire did not repurchase its own shares in Q3, indicating Buffett's belief that better investment opportunities will arise. This cautious strategic shift establishes a substantial cash and Treasury bill reserve, totaling $325 billion, enabling Berkshire to capitalize on future undervalued market opportunities and ensuring liquidity and low credit risk. Despite declining T-bill yields, this reserve generated approximately $3 billion in interest income in Q3, surpassing other major operational incomes of the company, reflecting Buffett's prudent approach amidst potential market turbulence."

SOFR & TGCR Spreads Begin to Move,\" written by Wolf Richter, explores the implications of the Federal Reserve's ongoing Quantitative Tightening (QT) measures on market liquidity. The recent dip in Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreements (ON RRPs) to $155 billion marks a significant liquidity reduction from its December 2022 peak of $2.4 trillion, reflecting a normalization of liquidity levels as money market funds, worth a total of $6.5 trillion, relocate their excess cash to higher-yield options like Treasury bills or the repo market. Despite concerns from Wall Street regarding potential disruptions below the $700 billion threshold, financial stability persists even as ON RRPs approach zero, indicating successful liquidity management. In the article's section \"Temporary rate pressures can be price signals that help markets redistribute liquidity: Fed\u2019s Logan,\" it highlights how minor fluctuations in indices such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) and the Treasury General Collateral Repo (TGCR), experienced at particular times like month-end, are signs of excess liquidity diminishing. Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan emphasizes these pressures can serve as useful price signals, assisting in redistributing liquidity efficiently and maintaining robust reserve balances, which remain unchanged at $3.24 trillion since the QT began in mid-2022. This ongoing adjustment reflects the Federal Reserve's strategy to recalibrate liquidity levels in the financial system, aiming for efficient balance sheet sizing and effective liquidity allocation, while tolerating temporary rate pressures as part of the process."

The \"The bond market figured it out too\" section details the bond market's reaction, with the 10-year Treasury yield rising to 4.35% in anticipation of inflationary effects from rising wages and the return of Boeing employees with substantial pay raises. The article also addresses the broader employment landscape and labor force growth, highlighting a low national unemployment rate of 4.1% and acknowledging complexities from new immigrant workforce contributions. Overall, while temporary factors disrupted job growth, the wage increases raised inflation concerns, prompting the bond market's response."

This plunge has landed the company on Wolf Street's list of Imploded Stocks, illustrating the volatile nature of AI-driven stock prices. The downward trajectory began after Ernst & Young, the company's auditor, resigned due to an inability to trust the financial representations of Super Micro, mirroring allegations by short-seller Hindenburg Research of dubious accounting practices. Further scrutiny by the Department of Justice into the accounting practices has compounded the stock's decline, with the delayed filing of the company's annual report intensifying investor fears. Nasdaq has mandated that the report be submitted by November 27, highlighting the risks tied to rapid market inflations spurred by AI hype, underscoring the need for financial transparency and accountability amid speculative frenzies. Despite the grim situation, there is a dark humor noted by market observers regarding the volatility and risks confronting investors who were lured by the AI boom."

The company's stock experienced a notable 42% drop over two days, culminating in a 76% decrease from its peak during the March 2024 AI-mania, reflecting the inherent volatility and inflated optimism common in tech stocks during market hypes. This downturn led by \"Super Micro Computer\u2019s Dramatic Fall\" highlights the risks of investing heavily in speculative trends, potentially resulting in significant investor losses. An exacerbating factor was the resignation of Ernst & Young, as discussed in \"Ernst & Young Resigns as Auditor,\" citing unreliability in financial representations by Super Micro's management. Their exit contrasts with short-seller Hindenburg Research's allegations of accounting irregularities, although Super Micro has expressed confidence in not restating its 2024 financial reports. \"Justice Department Investigation and Nasdaq's Extension\" brings attention to an ongoing investigation by the Department of Justice into the company's accounting practices, adding pressure and contributing to further stock devaluation.

The 12-month core PCE price index, which the Federal Reserve uses to target a 2% inflation rate, has shown no improvement for five months, maintaining a rise of 2.65% year-over-year as of September, thus indicating persistent inflationary pressures. In another section, September explaine the core PCE price index increased by 3.1% annualized from August, marking the highest month-to-month rise since April, driven by a 3.7% rise in core services and a 4.0% increase in durable goods prices, highlighting short-term inflationary fluctuations more distinctly than longer-term averages. The 3-month core PCE price index rose to 2.35% annualized, evidencing an upward trend in underlying inflation, whereas the 6-month index slowed slightly but stayed above previous year-end levels. The section on durable goods revealed a 4.0% spike in September, reversing prior deflationary trends, primarily due to price hikes in motor vehicles, furnishings, and appliances. Despite the temporary fluctuations, durable goods' 6-month and 12-month indices, though negative, indicated a decreased rate of decline. Lastly, the core services PCE index increased by 3.7% annually, albeit at a decelerated pace from the previous month, while the overall PCE index, including food and energy, rose by 2.1% year-over-year, largely due to a significant fall in energy prices and moderated food cost rises."

        "summary": "In the article \"Our Drunken Sailors Splurge in Q3, Phenomenally so on Durable Goods, Drive GDP Growth. But Debt-to-GDP Ratio Worsens\" by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street, the third quarter saw a significant increase in U.S. consumer spending, predominantly on durable goods, which drove GDP growth to an annualized rate of 2.8%, exceeding the pre-pandemic 15-year average of 2.0%. This rise in consumption, accounting for 69% of GDP, was especially marked in sectors like motor vehicles. However, this growth period also experienced a substantial rise in government spending, especially in defense, further inflating GDP figures but worsening the national debt through increased expenditure. The trade deficit, which has worsened for three consecutive quarters, negatively impacted GDP growth due to a surge in imports to meet domestic and holiday-related demands. Additionally, private fixed investment slowed, notably in residential investments with a deceleration to 1.3%. Despite some sectors like government spending increasing by 5%, they contributed less to GDP growth compared to consumer spending. Consequently, the debt-to-GDP ratio slightly rose to 120.8% in Q3 as the national debt grew faster than the GDP, highlighting the dichotomy between short-term economic gains and long-term financial stability. These elements collectively reflect the complexities of the economic landscape during this period."

The section titled \"Hiring Jumps for 3rd Month\" highlights that hiring increased for the third consecutive month, with 5.56 million hires, marking the first rise in the three-month average since February, suggesting ongoing staffing needs despite economic uncertainties. In \"Workers Cling to Jobs,\" it is noted that worker quits decreased sharply, benefiting employers by boosting productivity and reducing the need for competitive wages. The \"Layoffs & Discharges Jump but Remain Low\" section reveals that layoffs and discharges rose to 1.83 million in September, yet remain low compared to previous decades, possibly due to employers' past experiences with labor shortages. The concluding \"Job Openings Fall\" section points out that job openings declined to 7.44 million, aligning with pre-pandemic peak levels, as the labor force churn from previous years has ceased. While the ratio of job openings to nonfarm payrolls has slightly dipped, it still exceeds pre-pandemic highs, indicating a cooler yet strong labor market. The article also mentions that external factors, such as hurricanes Francine, Helene, and Milton, as well as the Boeing strike, could temporarily distort labor market data, complicating the Federal Reserve's assessment of the situation."

This capital raise comes after the company spent $64 billion on share buybacks between 2013 and 2019, leaving it without the necessary financial cushion in times of need. According to Richter, the company has recorded nearly $32 billion in net losses since 2019 and amassed $58 billion in debt, leading to negative equity. To address this, Boeing announced the issuance of 90 million common shares and $5 billion in mandatory convertible preferred stock, raising $22 billion to repair the damage from past buybacks. However, this will result in a 15% dilution for shareholders, decreasing earnings per share if profitability returns. Boeing's credit rating approaches junk status amid cash flow issues, production problems, and labor strikes, threatening future funding and debt repayment capabilities. Although the equity raise offers temporary relief, core production quality and structural problems persist, emphasizing the detrimental impact of prioritizing financial engineering over engineering expertise."

        "summary": "The article \"Treasury Yield Curve Un-Inversion Hits Milestone on Inflation Fears, Tsunami of Supply, QT. Mortgage Rates Near 7%\" by Wolf Richter discusses the dynamics of the Treasury yield curve, highlighting a significant rise in the 10-year yield by 60 basis points over a five-week period, reaching 4.25% despite the Federal Reserve's 50 basis point rate cut. This increase is driven by inflation fears and a massive supply of Treasuries needed to cover budget deficits, along with the Fed's continued quantitative tightening (QT) aimed at stabilizing longer-term yields. Mortgage rates, closely tied to the 10-year yield, are nearing 7%, reflecting these pressures on broader financial conditions. The divergence between rising long-term yields and declining short-term yields points to expectations of future rate cuts, though longer-term yields recover towards pre-inversion levels due to stronger economic indicators and rising inflation. Despite previous forecasts in the real estate industry for lower mortgage rates, the normalization of 30-year fixed rates, rising from 6.11% to 6.90%, now mirrors historical norms, with higher home prices rather than rates presenting a more significant challenge for the housing market. The section titled \"The drivers\u2026\" explores how anticipated inflation and the expected inflation and the expected supply of new Treasury securities are key factors influencing long-term yields, with bond investors particularly concerned about financial losses from yields that may not keep pace with inflation. The article further elaborates in \"How much further can the 10-year yield go?\" on the potential stabilization or decline of the 10-year yield if inflation moderates and the labor market cools, although the current acceleration of core CPI inflation and a strong labor market could exert upward pressure on yields, likely raising mortgage rates above 7% and potentially dampening economic activity."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter titled \"Treasury Buybacks: Update on the Bond Market Bloodletting\" focuses on the U.S. Treasury Department's recent actions to manage its debt amidst the upheaval in the bond market caused by rising interest rates. The article discusses the Treasury's strategy, which includes buying back 10-year Treasury notes, initially sold in August 2020 at a low yield of 0.677%, for 88 cents on the dollar due to their decreased value. The section by Wolf Richter outlines the initiation of a buyback program for Treasury securities in April, with the Treasury acquiring $7.0 billion in securities through October's auctions, although at significant discounts, highlighting the challenges from fluctuating yields. On October 23, the article specifies a buyback of $10 million in 30-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) from August 2020, and $40 million from August 2021, both with negative yields, reflecting past quantitative easing impacts. Further buybacks include $15 million and $40 million of 10-year TIPS repurchased with smaller discounts, indicative of quantitative tightening dynamics. On October 16, the Treasury reacquired various 7-year and 10-year notes, notably the 7-year notes from October 2020 and 10-year notes from February 2018 at 90.48% and 96.55% of par, showing a calculated buyback strategy. On October 10, the buyback included $17 million of new 7-year notes, $377 million of 10-year notes from April 2020, and $390 million of low yield August 2020 10-year notes, the latter at 82.71% of par. Meanwhile, on October 2, $22 million of 10-year TIPS from January 2018 and $10 million of 5-year TIPS from June 2023 were repurchased. The section \"Some buyback technicalities\" explores buyback mechanisms, clarifying they aren't novel but rather part of efforts to manage cash flow and liquidity, distinguishing these from Federal Reserve's Quantitative Easing as they entail using borrowed funds or tax revenue to replace old bonds with new ones by canceling repurchased securities."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article \"Inventory of New Spec Houses Spikes to Highest since 2009, Sales Grow as Builders Pile on Incentives and Trim Prices\" by Wolf Richter discusses the current dynamics of the housing market, highlighting that the inventory of new speculative homes has reached its highest level since 2009 due to builders increasing incentives and reducing prices to boost sales. Lennar, one of the major builders, has been at the forefront by offering significant discounts averaging $48,100 per house and reducing prices by 5.8% compared to the previous year. This strategy has enabled builders to capture market share from existing homes, where demand has decreased due to high prices. Consequently, new home sales have shown resilience despite challenging market conditions, with a 7.3% year-over-year increase in September sales of new single-family homes, matching the growth seen in September 2019. The segment \"Inventories balloon: a good thing, but not for builders\" details that the inventory of new completed houses has surged by 49% year-over-year, reaching its highest level since August 2009, with 110,000 homes. Speculative houses, which are ready for immediate occupancy, have driven this increase but have also caused financial pressure on builders due to the capital tied up in them, prompting swift sales through price reductions and incentives. Sales of completed new houses rose by 29% from the previous year, reaching 27,000 units, but the inventory of spec houses continues to grow, now standing at 4.1 months of supply at the current sales rate. The article also addresses \"Prices, mortgage-rate buydowns, and incentives,\" noting that while the median contract price for new single-family homes in September was $426,300, the six-month average declined to $418,000, marking the lowest point since May 2022. These prices benefit from mortgage rate buydowns and other incentives, significantly reducing buyers' monthly payments. Overall, the strategic use of incentives has allowed big homebuilders to maintain sales and capture market share amid the historically unusual conditions where new homes are priced competitively against existing ones, enabling them to navigate a market where many existing homeowners remain stagnant, anticipating rate drops."

This decline is attributed to high home prices leading to a buyers' strike, despite a brief period of lowered mortgage rates which have since increased, exacerbating the issue. The \"Demand Destruction for Existing Homes\" section outlines the diminishing demand despite rising inventory, lower mortgage rates, and seasonal adjustments, with the impact of higher mortgage rates worsening the situation. There's a surge in supply with 1.39 million homes in inventory, new listings rising as sellers attempt to capitalize on high prices, facing decreased demand and hesitant sellers. The \"Home Prices by Metro Vary Widely\" section discusses how home prices across metropolitan areas differ, with declines such as a 20% drop in Austin, while prices surge in cities like New York City. The \"Demand Destruction Has Occurred in All Regions\" section highlights demand destruction across all US regions, with the Northeastern US seeing sales nearly reach the lows of 2010, the Midwestern US hitting the lowest since the housing crash, the Southern US paralleling dips from the housing bust era, whereas the Western US saw a slight sales increase but still low since the 1990s. National Association of Realtors has shifted the blame away from high prices, attributing it to external factors like upcoming elections, though acknowledging the need for lower prices or significant wage growth to spur demand. Homebuilders have responded to these trends with lower prices and incentives, outperforming existing home sellers. Overall, these sections depict a widespread decline in home sales across the nation, with varying impacts in different metro areas and regions."

Discussed in the Balance Sheet Composition section, Logan details potential adjustments to the Fed's balance sheet, including the possibility of selling mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and transitioning its holdings from longer-term Treasury securities to Treasury bills (T-bills) to streamline the portfolio, balance its maturity range, and maintain market stability. These actions aim to support the broader monetary policy objectives and prepare the Fed to be flexible, especially if interest rates are reduced to 0%. In the Liquidity section, Logan urges banks to make use of the Standing Repo Facility (SRF) and the discount window to ensure preparedness as liquidity reduces due to QT. She emphasizes these tools' significance in maintaining financial stability and managing fluctuations, particularly at quarter-end. Logan's remarks contributed to bond market volatility, reflecting the complexities of normalizing monetary policy tools and the Fed's evolving role as a liquidity provider."

In Section M, it is highlighted that real estate professionals are surprised by the impact on housing affordability and market dynamics, as the expected benefits of rate cuts have not occurred, creating challenges for potential homebuyers. Section B emphasizes that the 10-year yield reaching 4.20% is the highest since July 26, influenced by hawkish comments from Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, concerns about inflation, and increasing government debt. The situation presents challenges for bondholders amid Quantitative Tightening (QT), inflation, and rising debt supply, further complicating mortgage rates. In Section Y, the yield curve's changes are addressed, noting the 30-year yield's alignment with the 6-month yield\u2014ending an inversion from July 2022\u2014and the unmet expectations that rate cuts would reduce mortgage rates. This is due to short-term yields dropping while long-term yields rise from inflation fears and new debt supply, leaving only 3- to 5-year yields under 4%. Lastly, Section T explains the 1-year Treasury yield's rise to 4.25%, indicating changing market expectations about rate cuts, and the increase of the 2-year yield to 4.04% after de-inverting with the 10-year yield in early September. These movements underscore the complexities in forecasting interest rate paths amid economic uncertainties and policy shifts."

Despite China's decreasing stake due to geopolitical tensions and a strategic shift to diversify its reserves, and Japan's struggles with a weakening yen, foreign interest in US debt has persisted, driven by relatively attractive US Treasury yields that eclipse those of many foreign sovereign debts. In the section \u201cWhich Foreign Countries Bought the Recklessly Ballooning US Debt: An Increasingly Crucial Question,\u201d the article reports foreign-held US debt reached a record high of $8.50 trillion in August, constituting 24.1% of the total US debt, up from 22.2% in October 2023. \"Many Piled it up\" notes that the Euro Area and other financial centers have significantly increased their holdings, contrasting the decline from China and stagnation from Japan, thereby altering the composition of US debt holders. The UK and other hubs have notably increased their positions, while smaller countries like Canada, Taiwan, and India have shown pronounced growth, underpinning their rising influence in the treasury market. The section \"Cleanest Dirty Shirt?\" remarks that Japan, despite maintaining substantial holdings, faces currency and policy challenges, highlighting little change over the past decade, amidst global economic uncertainties.

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article \"Used Vehicles Getting Ready to Turn into Inflation Headwind, after Historic Plunge Had Powered Core CPI 'Deceleration'\" by Wolf Richter highlights the evolving challenges in the used vehicle market that are poised to impact inflationary trends. During the pandemic, heightened demand and supply constraints, particularly stemming from semiconductor shortages and cuts in new vehicle production, caused a surge in used vehicle prices by over 50% between mid-2020 and mid-2022, which was then followed by a sharp decline in 2022 as consumer behavior shifted, as discussed in \"Used-vehicle retail inventory fell further.\" Retail inventory levels drastically fell due to the lower availability of new vehicles (~6 million fewer sold from Q2 2021 to Q1 2023), impacting typical sources like rental fleets and lease returns. Consequently, \"Wholesale prices in the first half of October\" indicate a stabilization in the market, with the Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index showing marginal seasonal increases, suggesting the previous price drop is stabilizing, and year-over-year declines are shrinking. Similarly, in \"Used-vehicle retail listing prices,\" the average listing price at dealerships stabilized just above $25,000 in 2024, indicating a plateau informed by existing supply-demand dynamics. The section \"The first sign this is feeding into CPI\" reveals that in September, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for used vehicles experienced a month-to-month rise of 0.3%, halving the year-over-year decline to -5.1%. This stabilization ends the previous contribution of used vehicle price drops to slowing core CPI, with tight inventories and steady demand potentially leading to an upward pressure on core CPI, underscoring the broader economic implications."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter titled \"Landing Cancelled? Retail Sales Jump, Prior Months Revised Up, Boost Atlanta Fed GDPNow to +3.4% Inflation-Adjusted GDP Growth\" highlights an unexpected surge in retail sales, with revisions for prior months leading to the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow forecast projecting a 3.4% inflation-adjusted growth for Q3. This increase in consumer spending raises inflation concerns as it could further drive up prices. Contributing to this growth is a significant influx of immigrants from 2022-2024, adding to economic activity. The \"Retail sales in total and by category\" section reports a 0.6% rise in September retail sales and a 2.3% year-over-year growth, despite deflationary trends in some goods. Vehicle and parts stores showed a modest 0.7% increase, while ecommerce grew by 7%. Food services recovered with a 3.7% increase, and food and beverage stores saw a 2.3% rise. Gas station sales fell due to cheaper gasoline, while the building and clothing sectors experienced minor growths of 0.2% and 2.3%, respectively. Miscellaneous retailers, notably including cannabis stores, jumped by 7.1%, reflecting higher cannabis prices, and general merchandise stores had a 3.1% increase, all indicative of steady consumer demand. These economic changes suggest a trajectory that may defy the expected 'soft landing,' possibly maintaining higher growth and inflation."

        "summary": "In the article \"Home-Purchase Demand Destruction Accelerates, Prices Too High, Buyers\u2019 Strike Deepens: Sales of Existing Homes Head for Worst Year since 1995\" by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street, the declining demand for home purchases amidst high prices is emphasized as buyers remain on strike, anticipating more affordable housing options. The section \"Home-Purchase Demand Destruction Accelerates, Prices Too High, Buyers\u2019 Strike Deepens\" highlights how this resistance to purchase is set to drive the sales of existing homes to their lowest point since 1995, with the market dynamics heavily influenced by significant price points. According to \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET,\" since reaching nearly 8% by October 2023, mortgage rates have pressured demand, which stays subdued even after rates fell to about 6% in November 2023. The ongoing buyer's strike has persisted into 2024, as per \"The demand for existing homes in the market,\" with potential buyers sidelined by high housing costs despite increased inventory. Data from the Mortgage Bankers Association supports this low demand, reinforced by Fannie Mae's analysis predicting sustained affordability challenges suppressing home sales through 2024. In \"Mortgage rates experienced an uptick amid economic activity,\" the upward movement of mortgage rates to an average of 6.52% further complicates the picture for home sales, as even the previous interest rate drops hadn't improved sales significantly. This scenario is also marked by a decline in refinance mortgage applications, underlining the inverse relationship between mortgage rates and refinancing activity, thereby portraying a housing market wrestling with persistent affordability issues and consistently high prices."

        "summary": "In September, Canada's housing market underwent significant changes with price declines in major cities like Toronto, Vancouver, Victoria, and Calgary, coinciding with a surge in new listings influenced by recent rate cuts. This influx of properties was not met with matching buyer demand, particularly impacting condo sales, as discussed in the section titled \"The Most Splendid Housing Bubbles in Canada, September.\" Despite overall price declines due to falling interest rates, as mentioned in \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET,\" single-family home prices decreased by 0.5% month-over-month and 2.8% year-over-year, while condos fell by 1.0% from August and 4.0% annually. Since their March 2022 peak, single-family homes have diminished by 16.7% and condos by 11.4%. \"Sales and inventory in Canada\" highlighted a 1.9% increase in home sales in September from August, with a 6.9% rise year-over-year, though still 7% below the 10-year average. This was partly due to the Bank of Canada's rate cuts, which spurred seller activity, resulting in new property listings increasing by 4.9% from August and 16.8% year-over-year. \"Home prices by market in Canada\" described specific regional trends, such as Greater Toronto Area single-family homes and condos falling 18.4% and 16.6% from their respective peaks, with Hamilton-Burlington seeing similar declines. Conversely, Quebec City showed a year-over-year increase. Greater Vancouver faced both single-family and condo declines, while Edmonton experienced monthly steadiness and Montreal saw growth in single-family homes, underscoring a varied national housing market outlook."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article \"Venture Capital Slammed by Fed Tightening: Exits Blocked after IPOs & SPACs Collapsed, Distributions at Financial Crisis Lows\" by Wolf Richter discusses the significant challenges facing the venture capital (VC) industry following the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes and the end of the free-money era. The tightening policies have led to a substantial reduction in exits, with public listings via IPOs and SPACs dropping dramatically by 91% in 2023 compared to 2021, causing a disrupted cycle of exits, fundraising, and dealmaking in the VC ecosystem. This blockage has resulted in many VC-backed companies staying private longer and struggling with funding, often necessitating new funding rounds at lower valuations, leading to a 26% growth in the backlog of private companies over three years. As a result, cash distributions to Limited Partners have plummeted to levels reminiscent of the global financial crisis, and a rise in \"zombie VCs\"\u2014firms existing mainly to collect management fees without making new investments\u2014has complicated the landscape further. Despite these challenges, certain sectors like AI still manage to attract investments, though overall, the scenario reflects a challenging environment for venture capitalists influenced by macroeconomic factors and regulatory changes. The article mentions a call for rate cuts to alleviate the situation, combined with a rise in longer-term Treasury yields, complicating investment dynamics and potentially causing long-term disruptions in exiting VC investments."

The Federal Reserve's decision to cut policy rates on September 18 was based on data suggesting a slowdown, yet subsequent revisions revealed stronger-than-expected economic growth, challenging those assumptions. In \"A bunch of massive up-revisions after the Fed meeting,\" upward revisions to consumer income and savings, improved economic indicators, and strong labor market data suggest a healthier economy than initially thought. Despite energy prices dropping, inflation is not subsiding as expected, with core CPI and producer prices rising, signaling increasing inflationary pressures (\"And so inflation is no longer going in the right direction\"). The Fed's policy rates remain above inflation, although there's debate about their restrictiveness and the real effective federal funds rate (\"The Fed\u2019s policy rates are still well above inflation rates\"). Sectors like AI are flourishing amid high interest rates, while commercial real estate struggles, indicating mixed signals across the economy (\"Yet the signals diverge\"). Finally, \"The media has declared victory over inflation, not the Fed\" underscores the Fed's cautious stance and preparedness for potential rate hikes if inflation accelerates again, suggesting higher interest rates could ultimately drive better economic decisions and stability."

Over the past six months, core PPI rose by 3.4% and services PPI increased by 3.7%, suggesting persistent inflationary pressures, despite considerable declines in energy prices, which offer some relief. The section \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET\" notes that in September, the PPI saw only a minimal increase of 0.05% due to declining energy prices; however, excluding energy, the PPI saw significant inflation due to revised upward monthly changes. Core PPI rose by 1.9% annualized in September, with trends suggesting more accelerated inflation in 2024. In the section titled the \"Services PPI\" a 2.0% annualized increase is observed in September, with revisions from prior months leading to a six-month average acceleration to 3.7%. Additionally, the \"finished core goods\" PPI rose 2.6% annualized, remaining steady but suggesting inflation parameters from pre-pandemic times. Finally, \"For overall PPI,\" there was a moderate annualized increase of 0.6% in September, with past month revisions pushing the six-month average to 2.3%. While energy price drops mitigate general inflation, the service sector continues to exert inflationary pressure, and future inflation will depend on energy prices and other segment pressures."

        "summary": "The article from Wolf Street provides an analysis of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), highlighting that core CPI, excluding volatile food and energy prices, has accelerated for the third consecutive month due to a rise in used vehicle prices and persistent service inflation, despite a drop in gasoline prices. Under the Homeowner Insurance Rates section, the Owners' Equivalent Rent (OER), a significant component of CPI that tracks the imputed rent homeowners would pay if renting, increased at a faster rate than actual rents, reflecting rising costs for homeowners. In another section discussing Year-over-Year realizations, core CPI's year-over-year increase is 3.3%, driven by services, whereas the Overall CPI decelerated to 2.4% due to a drop in gasoline prices. The Core Services CPI section elaborates on the mixed results, with short-term metrics indicating a 4.4% rise in inflation, contrasting with a 6-month deceleration, driven by lower June readings, indicating varying inflationary pressures across time frames. Housing Components of Core Services discusses how housing expenses, particularly property insurance and taxes, influence OER, contributing to CPI. This section also notes substantial inflation in motor-vehicle insurance and service costs. In the Food Inflation section, the \"food at home\" CPI increased by 26% since January 2020, with significant year-over-year hikes, notably in egg prices, indicating ongoing inflation challenges in grocery sectors. The Apparel and Footwear section reports a shift from pre-pandemic deflation trends, with a 1.8% month-over-month rise in their prices. Meanwhile, in the Energy sector, the overall CPI fell by 1.9% month-over-month due mainly to a 4.1% drop in gasoline prices, countering inflation in electricity and natural gas, with some commodities like heating oil experiencing declines. Collectively, these elements contribute to a complex inflationary environment, with core components driving persistent pressure despite some offsetting declines."

This movement hints at investors losing faith in the Federal Reserve's ability to combat inflation effectively. In the section by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET, the U.S. Treasury's sale of $39 billion in 10-year notes at a yield of 4.066% attracted strong demand, especially from foreign investors. The uptick in yields for longer maturities, symptomatic of inflation concerns and increased debt issuance due to a rising deficit, counterbalances expectations of rate cuts for shorter-term yields, resulting in a gradual un-inversion of the yield curve. Although the 10-year and 30-year yields remain just shy of pre-rate cut expectation levels, mortgage rates have jumped, with the 30-year fixed rate now at 6.61%. The bond market remains wary of inflation risks indicated by rising wages, revised job creation figures, accelerated CPI inflation, and a potential boom in debt supply, which fuels the uncertainty and volatility in the market."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article \"Florida Housing Market Buckles\" details the challenges facing the Florida housing market, with listing prices dropping to a 30-month low yet remaining high. The market is saturated with a significant increase in inventory as properties linger longer without offers. Anthony Holmes's experience exemplifies these difficulties as his Tampa home, bought for $550,000 in 2021 and improved with $50,000, remains unsold at a reduced price of $583,900 after eight months on the market, highlighting the issue of prices being too high. \"We know why he \u201ccan\u2019t unload the thing\u201d\" points out that homes aren't selling due to unrealistic listing prices despite increased Florida home purchases over the years. The median listing price has fallen by 11% since June 2022, with single-family home sales seeing only a slight gain and condo prices declining. In \"Price reductions to deal with a too-high listing price,\" the article notes Florida's 76% increase in price reductions, indicating adjustments were needed to draw in buyers. Many are disregarding seller investments, and sales need realistic pricing. \"Big institutional investors have turned into net sellers\" examines how large investors, having seen substantial gains, are capitalizing by selling properties they bought during the mortgage crisis, adding to listings in places like Tampa, Orlando, and Jacksonville. This intensifies competition for sellers like Holmes. He's also competing against those who purchased properties in the Housing Bust and can still profit even with lower sale prices. Therefore, \"That\u2019s the competition Mr. Holmes has to deal with\" underlines his struggle with mounting costs as his vacant home remains unsold amid a downward market. With \"Active listings pile up,\" Florida records a 35% surge in active listings compared to the previous year, the highest for any September since data collection started in 2016, signaling weakened demand due to high prices. In \"Median Days on the Market drag out,\" properties are taking longer to sell, with median days reaching 74, the highest since September 2019, hinting at desperation among some sellers. Lastly, \"So we wish Mr. Holmes best of luck\" suggests Holmes, having bought during a housing bubble, should act fast and reduce prices to curb his losses, illustrating the risk in real estate investments during market downturns."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article \"People Are Now on Buyers\u2019 Strike Because Home Prices Are too High: Fannie Mae\" highlights the current challenges in the housing market. It discusses how Fannie Mae's Home Purchase Sentiment Index (HPSI) initially rose to a 30-month high of 73.9 in September due to consumer optimism about declining mortgage rates. However, after a Federal Reserve rate cut, mortgage rates unexpectedly surged, leading to renewed inflation concerns. This shift has intensified difficulties for potential homebuyers already facing high property prices, sparking what is termed a \"buyer\u2019s strike,\" where many are refusing to purchase due to unsustainable costs, slowing the market. In the \"by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET\" section, it's noted that the HPSI increase reflects cautious optimism for lower mortgage rates, although it's still significantly below the 2019 level of 91.5. In the \"Great time to sell, terrible time to buy: that doesn\u2019t work\" section, it's noted that 65% of consumers believe it's a good time to sell, resulting in increased home inventory as sellers list properties amid lower mortgage rates, yet 81% perceive it as a bad time to buy, collapsing demand for existing homes. The \"Buyers\u2019 strike because prices are too high: Fannie Mae\" section elaborates further on how high prices, despite shifting sentiments towards more favorable mortgage rates, prevent buyers from entering the market, with existing home sales predicted to slump to their lowest since 1995. Even with brief optimism from initially lowered rates, current increases have reignited hesitance. Many consumers expect continued price hikes, negating any affordability gains from reduced rates, although areas like Austin show declining prices when buyers withdraw. Fannie Mae forecasts a persistent buyers' strike despite rate cuts and more listings, with consumers still hoping for lower rates, prices, and improved wages that haven't materialized, stressing the need for price adjustments to enhance housing affordability."

The section \"More Evidence this May Be the End of the Historic Plunge of Used Vehicle Prices that Had Pushed Down CPI\" suggests that tight supply and strong demand may stabilize the market. Although wholesale prices decreased slightly in September, the decline was less pronounced than usual, and prices have already shed nearly half of their pandemic-related increase, indicating stabilization. \"Used-vehicle retail inventories remain tight\" highlights a drop in retail inventory due to diminished new vehicle production caused by semiconductor shortages, although used vehicle retail sales improved by 9% year-over-year in September. \"Prices of used EVs and ICE vehicles\" explores the price dynamics where used electric vehicle (EV) prices rose significantly between January 2020 and July 2022 but have since declined by 53% of their spike, while internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle prices followed a similar pattern with a 46% reduction of the spike. EV prices are still notably higher than ICE prices compared to pre-pandemic levels. Lastly, \"Wholesale prices in some of the most popular segments\" reviews trends in segments where SUV and compact car prices gained slightly in September but are down year-over-year, while pickup trucks and midsize cars faced declines, all of which have seen substantial reductions from their pandemic peaks."

        "summary": "The article by Wolf Richter on Wolf Street discusses the significant increase in mortgage rates, which have reached their highest levels since the early 2000s, alongside the spike in yields for 2-year and 10-year Treasury securities due to market adjustments. This spike has dampened expectations for large-scale interest rate cuts while inflation fears have resurfaced, complicating changes in the bond market. In the section \"Yields jumped the most in the middle on crushed rate-cut expectations,\" it is highlighted that medium-term securities saw increases, with the 2-year yield rising significantly and reflecting a shift away from aggressive rate-cut hopes. The 10-year yield also increased, signaling inflation concerns and US debt supply issues. The section \"Despite the drama on the long end, not much happened at the short end\" explains that short-term yields, influenced by anticipated rate cuts, showed minimal changes with the 3-month yield seeing a slight increase but fluctuating within a narrow range. Meanwhile, the yield curve un-inversion due to fluctuating short-term yields and surging long-term yields didn't lead to the expected cheaper mortgage rates. Historically, after treasury yields decreased significantly in anticipation of rate cuts from July to September, the scenario shifted from September to October with short-term yields decreasing further while long-term yields began to increase, indicating a change in market outlook amid inflation fears. The article concludes with the observation that the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate significantly rose as the Fed's decreased market support and absence of Quantitative Easing reshape market dynamics."

In September, the Fed's balance sheet decreased by $66 billion, now standing at $7.05 trillion, a level first reached in May 2020 following massive quantitative easing (QE) during the pandemic. Since April 2022, the Fed has reduced its balance sheet by $1.92 trillion, shedding 40% of the pandemic's QE assets. The \"QT Assets by Category\" section highlights that the Fed reduced Treasury securities by $24 billion, totaling a $1.41 trillion reduction since June 2022. Holdings of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) decreased by $18 billion, totaling a $458 billion reduction from its peak. In \"Bank Liquidity Facilities,\" the Discount Window balance remains at $1.6 billion, while the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) borrowed amounts decreased by $27 billion to $71 billion in September. The Fed plans to phase out BTFP by March 2025. The section \"Balance Sheet below $7.0 Trillion\u2026\" predicts the balance will fall below $7 trillion as $48 billion in assets roll off soon, driven by a $42 billion monthly reduction in Treasury and MBS, while the BTFP's decline could influence the total. If trends remain steady, the balance sheet should dip below $7 trillion by late October or November 2023, a detail marking its decline from the April 2022 peak of $8.97 trillion."

        "summary": "In the article \"Here Come the Vacant Homes,\" author Wolf Richter discusses the unexpected surge in new home listings during September, a month typically characterized by a decrease in listings. The significant increase in listings, particularly in areas like San Diego and Southern Silicon Valley, indicates that many sellers are releasing their vacant homes into the market, responding to sluggish sales due to prices perceived as too high by potential buyers. Consequently, active listings have risen 34% year-over-year, with notable increases in cities like Tampa, Orlando, Seattle, and Miami, as sellers who previously held onto properties during price spikes now contribute to the increased housing inventory. The \"But buyers are still on strike because prices are too high\" section highlights that existing home demand has decreased as prices remain high, leading buyers to prefer new houses that often come with lower prices and incentives from homebuilders. Despite a brief decline, mortgage rates have risen again following the Fed's September rate cut, keeping mortgage applications at historic lows. The median listing price for homes has declined for several consecutive months, going below levels seen two years ago, with 23 of the top 50 metro areas, including Miami, witnessing notable price drops. Homes are also taking longer to sell, with the median days on the market reaching 55 days in September, the highest since 2019. Despite significant price reductions, demand remains weak, indicating challenges in attracting buyers in the current market environment."

But EV Sales Jumped, even at GM & Ford\" discusses the challenging conditions faced by automakers in the third quarter as internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle sales declined, while electric vehicle (EV) sales surged. In the section by Wolf Richter, it is highlighted that US new vehicle sales fell by 5% year-over-year to 3.88 million units, due to sustained high vehicle prices initially caused by shortages. Stellantis experienced a notable 20% decline in sales, illustrating elevated pricing strategies' impact. Despite increased incentives by 63% year-over-year to $3,047 per vehicle, automakers are still focused on high profit margins, with average transaction prices decreasing by 3% year-over-year in September to $44,467. In the \"Sales at the biggest automakers in Q3\" section, General Motors saw a 2.2% sales decline despite a rise in EV sales and is expanding its lineup amidst supply chain challenges. Toyota\u2019s sales decreased by 8%, yet its first battery-electric model, the bZ4X, gained traction. Ford experienced minor sales growth with a 12.2% rise in EV sales, adjusting its strategy due to competitive pressures. Hyundai-Kia\u2019s sales grew by 5.5%, and they plan to shift EV production to the US by 2025. Honda's sales increased by 8% with the Prologue EV. Stellantis faced significant sales declines due to excess inventory and dealer dissatisfaction. Nissan had a slight sales decrease but substantial EV sales growth, while Tesla's global sales growth continues, though their high-growth narrative is waning."

        "summary": "Tesla reported a rise in global deliveries in its best Q3 performance ever, with 462,890 vehicles delivered, reflecting a 4.3% increase from Q2 and a 6.4% rise year-over-year. However, Tesla's growth is not meeting the previously anticipated high-growth rates, as total deliveries of 1.294 million vehicles in the first three quarters show a 2.3% decline compared to the same period in 2023. Tesla will need to deliver a record 515,000 vehicles in Q4 to exceed its 2023 figures. The high-growth narrative is struggling due to insufficient recovery in Q2 following a significant Q1 drop. Model 3 and Model Y deliveries also hit a record in Q3 with 439,975 units, but are still behind Q1 and Q4 of last year. The Model Y is now the second best-selling vehicle in the US, just behind the Toyota RAV4 and ahead of the Ford F-150, while overall EV sales achieved a 9% market share in Q2. However, Tesla's US EV market share is dropping toward 50% amidst rising competition. Cybertruck production is gradually ramping up, contributing to 22,915 \"Other Models\" delivered in Q3, with expectations to reach 250,000 units by 2025, although current production is at 1,000 per week. In China, Tesla faces a price war and fierce competition, particularly from BYD, leading to sales incentives and discounts. In California, Tesla's biggest market in the US, sales declined for four quarters amidst rising sales of other EVs; while the Model Y remains the best-seller, its sales dropped 15% year-over-year in Q2, posing challenges for Tesla as further Q3 data emerges."

Dallas Availability Rate Dips to 30%, Houston rises to 29% | Wolf Street\" by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET discusses the unprecedented surplus in the commercial real estate market across major US cities. It highlights how cities such as San Francisco, Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, Seattle, and Washington DC have recorded all-time high office space availability, contrasting sharply with the pre-pandemic \"war for space\" period when office spaces were in high demand. The section \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET\" reports that in Q3 the availability rates for office leases were highest in San Francisco at 36.6%, followed by Atlanta, Dallas-Ft. Worth, Chicago, and Houston, countering landlord claims that the glut had plateaued. Limited new supply and high demand in 2019 have been overturned by pandemic-induced corporate tenant rethinking, particularly with leasing activities focusing on renewals, relocations, and downsizing. This focus, coupled with a \"flight to quality\" where tenants prefer top-tier offices, has left older buildings with high vacancy rates, reduced value, and increased financial struggles. The final section notes that San Francisco, once thriving, now sees a 36.7% availability rate and a 24% drop in Class A rents since 2019, while other markets have faced rent increases as landlords struggle to meet loan obligations."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter, titled \"Balance of Power Changed, Employers Re-exert Control, but Also Cling to Their Workers,\" discusses the shifting dynamics in the labor market. Employers are regaining control as fewer workers are quitting, likely due to fears of layoffs, leading to fewer job openings and reduced hiring activity. Despite these concerns, actual layoffs remain historically low. The voluntary quits have dropped to their lowest since early 2018, resulting in reduced job churn and a stabilized labor market. However, new job creation has slowed considerably. Job openings, although still high, have decreased from pandemic levels, making the ratio of job openings to unemployed people remain over 1, indicating more jobs than job seekers, but this ratio is lower than in the pre-pandemic labor market. Employers are holding on to their workers, as evidenced by layoffs and discharges being historically low. The drop in hiring is linked to a stable labor market but raises concerns about the slowdown in new job creation, with the ratio of hires to nonfarm payrolls being lower than the tight labor markets of 2017-2019."

Jonathan Gray of Blackstone and other CRE fund managers suggest the market may have hit bottom, but significant challenges remain. The office CMBS delinquency rate surged to 8.4%, the highest since the Great Recession, driven by an oversupply of office space that companies no longer need. The retail CMBS delinquency rate rose to 7.1%, with the ongoing shift to ecommerce leading to abandoned malls and bankrupt retail chains. Lodging CMBS saw a delinquency rate increase to 6.2%, impacted by tourists' preference for vacation rentals over hotels, exacerbating hotel vacancy rates in tourist-heavy cities. Multifamily CMBS remained steady at a 3.3% delinquency rate, significantly lower than its peak during the Great Recession, with US government guarantees covering over half the market. The industrial CMBS sector, however, remains robust with a historically low delinquency rate of 0.3%, driven by ecommerce demand despite some oversupply during the pandemic. The article underscores the varying health of different CRE sectors, noting that structural problems in office, retail, and lodging are unlikely to be mitigated by changes in monetary policy."

Central Banks Diversify to 'Nontraditional' Currencies and Gold,\" it is reported that central banks worldwide are increasingly diversifying their reserves away from the US dollar, with its share dropping to the lowest level since 1995. Despite this trend, China's renminbi has not gained ground and continues to lag as a global reserve currency, even falling behind the Australian dollar. The article notes that as of Q2 2024, the US dollar's share of global foreign exchange reserves stands at 58.2%, down from 66% in 2015, with a potential decline to 50% over the next decade. Historically, the USD's share of global reserves fluctuated significantly, hitting a low of 46% in 1991 due to high inflation in the US. Central banks globally held $12.35 trillion in reserves by Q2 2024, with $6.68 trillion denominated in USD. The euro remains the second-largest reserve currency, holding around 20% of global reserves. The emergence of \"nontraditional reserve currencies\" has seen their share rise from 2.5% in 2019 to 4.2% in Q2 2024. The IMF identifies 46 \"active diversifiers\" holding at least 5% of their reserves in these currencies. Gold has also re-emerged as a favoured reserve asset, with central banks increasing their holdings to around 1.16 billion troy ounces, valued at $3.1 trillion. Additionally, the article notes that foreign exchange reserves are reported in USD, leading to variations in value based on exchange rates. Despite these fluctuations, the US Dollar Index (DXY) has remained relatively stable."

        "summary": "The recent article \"Consumer Income & Savings Rate Revised Massively Higher for 2 Years, Spending Revised Up Too. Stunning Numbers\" by Wolf Richter reveals that data revisions from the Bureau of Economic Analysis indicate consumers have experienced higher incomes, greater savings rates, and increased spending over the past two years than previously estimated, suggesting a more robust post-pandemic economic recovery. The section \"Personal income_without_transfer receipts, adjusted for inflation,\" shows that personal income without government transfers grew at a year-over-year rate of 3.1% in August and 3.2% in July, substantially higher than the 1.6% previously estimated for July. The revised two-year increase is now 6.0%, compared to the older estimate of 3.6%. In the section \"Disposable income, adjusted for inflation,\" the revised disposable income data reveals year-over-year increases of 3.1% for August and 3.2% for July, contrasting sharply with the 1.1% old estimate for July. Over two years, this metric shows an 8.5% increase, higher than the initial 5.5%, with five revised months recording growth over 3.1%. The section \"Consumer spending adjusted for inflation\" indicates slightly higher consumer spending, with revised year-over-year gains of 2.9% for August and 2.8% for July, marginally up from the 2.7% old estimate, and a 5.6% rise over two years versus the 5.3% previously reported. The section \"And the savings rate, oh-la-la\" reports a significant upward revision in the savings rate to 4.8% in August and 4.9% in July, far above the initial 2.9%, altering the perception of consumers being reckless spenders. Lastly, the \"GDP too\" section details that revised GDP figures show the pandemic economic growth was stronger than previously thought, with Q2 2024 GDP being $305 billion higher than earlier estimates and a 5.8% real GDP growth since late 2021, compared to the former 4.9%."

Durable Goods -2.2%, Energy -10%,\" Wolf Richter details the recent trends in the Fed's favored inflation measure, the Core PCE price index, which increased by 2.7% year-over-year in August, marking its highest rise since April due to rising core services inflation of 3.8%. Despite decreases in durable goods prices (-2.2%) and energy prices (-10%), inflation remains high, particularly in the housing sector, frustrating Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The overall PCE price index, including food and energy, rose 2.2% year-over-year in August, moderated by significant declines in energy prices and slower food price increases. The month-to-month moves section highlights a 1.6% annualized increase in the core PCE price index from July, indicating a deceleration with core services prices rising and durable goods falling. The six-month annualized core PCE index decelerated to 2.4%, with core services contributing factors like housing and healthcare rising by 2.8% annualized in August and a six-month trend of 3.3%. Housing costs surged 5.7% annualized, maintaining high inflation rates. In contrast, durable goods prices fell 2.9% annualized due to decreased pandemic-driven demand and better supply chains."

        "summary": "In the article \"Corporate Pricing Power and Therefore Inflation Not Vanquished, Says Renewed Spike in Corporate Profits in Most Industries\" by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street, it is reported that corporate profits surged in Q2 across most industries, indicating ongoing robust pricing power and maintaining inflationary pressures despite measures to curb it. In the section \"Corporate profits have surged in Q2 across most industries,\" the article notes that underlying dynamics challenge the notion that inflation has been subdued. During 2021 and 2022\u2019s inflation shock, corporate profits soared due to increased pricing power, which allowed companies to hike prices, thus propagating inflation. According to the section \"By Wolf Richter for Wolf Street,\" corporate pre-tax profits in non-financial industries grew by 4.1% from Q1 and 12.5% year-over-year in Q2, driven by businesses adjusting prices quicker than their costs. Profits notably jumped in sectors like construction, healthcare, and tech, indicating increased consumer and business willingness to absorb these costs, while worker demands for higher wages further contributed to price adjustments. Despite efforts by the Federal Reserve to curb inflation by raising the cost of capital, falling long-term interest rates have complicated this fight. The section \"Profits across various industries, such as financials, information, retail, and manufacturing, showed notable increases,\" states that while wholesale trade and transportation marked a slight dip, the methodology behind these figures includes adjustments for inventory valuation, capital consumption, and exclusions of capital gains and dividends to accurately reflect profits from current production."

Sales Jump, Builders Take Share from Homeowners,\" written by Wolf Richter, reports a significant increase in the inventory of completed new single-family houses, reaching its highest level since 2009 with a 46% year-over-year increase and over 200% growth since mid-2021, culminating in 104,000 units in August. This surge is helping to address price dislocations in the broader housing market. Builders are gaining market share from individual homeowners as sales of new spec houses jump. The inventories of all houses under construction have grown to 470,000 units, reflecting a rising trend with a current supply duration of 8.2 months. Sales of completed houses saw a 53% year-over-year increase to 29,000 units, providing critical market supply. Sales of houses at various construction stages grew 11.5% year-over-year to about 58,000 in August, a 4% rise from August 2019, with homebuilders benefiting from the reluctance of existing homeowners to lower their price expectations. \"Prices of new houses have dropped to prices of resale houses\" notes that contract prices for new single-family houses fell 4.6% from the previous year and 8.8% from the October 2022 peak, excluding mortgage-rate buydowns averaged at $47,100 per house. Builders are constructing less expensive homes with fewer amenities and additional incentives, resulting in the median price of new houses aligning closely with resale house prices at $421,533 in August. Lastly, \"Homebuilders take an ever-larger share from homeowners\" highlights that new single-family houses accounted for over 17% of total single-family house sales in July and August, a rate not seen consistently since before the Financial Crisis. This indicates that big homebuilders are effectively navigating the current market by aggressively pricing new homes and offering incentives, which helps mitigate the pricing issues in the housing market."

Despite the growth in other sectors, the unemployment rate has risen to 3.9%. Substantial job declines have been recorded in the Information, Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services, and Financial Activities sectors since mid-2022. These sectors, heavily impacted by the relocation of major financial institutions like Wells Fargo and Charles Schwab, haven't been compensated by the gains in healthcare and other industries. Information sector jobs are down by 20% from their peak in 2022, now at their lowest since January 2020, while Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services have seen an 8.1% decrease since June 2022.

        "summary": "Days after a rate cut, S&P's Flash PMI data indicates rising inflation and urges the Federal Reserve to \"move cautiously\" with additional rate cuts. The data highlights a \"reacceleration of inflation,\" suggesting that the Fed should not entirely divert its attention from its inflation target. This development underscores the complex balancing act facing the Federal Reserve between fostering economic growth and managing inflationary pressures. The latest S&P preliminary Flash US Composite PMI, collected from September 12 to 20, warns about the potential need for cautious Fed rate cuts due to reaccelerating selling-price inflation in both services and manufacturing sectors, and increasing input-cost inflation in services. The report suggests the Fed's FOMC might need to be cautious in implementing further rate cuts in light of these inflationary pressures. September's Composite PMI score of 54.4 indicates solid business activity growth, rounding off the strongest quarter since early 2022. Strong growth in the services sector, the majority of the economy, drove this while manufacturing sector output slightly declined. The summary section titled \"Continued divergence between services and manufacturing\" states that the S&P\u2019s Flash Services PMI for August was 55.4, indicating solid growth at the second-highest rate in 29 months. Services have maintained a similar pace of growth for the past five months and are a significant part of the economy. In contrast, manufacturing, which represents a smaller fraction of the economy and employment, has struggled post-pandemic. For September, the flash Manufacturing PMI dropped modestly to 47, a 15-month low, indicating contraction. The section \"Inflation dynamics entail a warning to the Fed about rate cuts\" elaborates that inflation dynamics are signaling caution to the Federal Reserve regarding potential rate cuts. Both goods and services are experiencing price increases at the fastest pace seen in six months, driven notably by rising wages in the services sector. This \"reacceleration of inflation\" indicates the Fed cannot completely disregard its inflation targets while aiming to maintain economic growth, prompting a careful approach to rate cuts despite a weakening hiring trend. Selling price inflation is rising in both services and manufacturing, reaching six-month highs and surpassing pre-pandemic averages, indicating persistently high rates of increase. Input cost inflation shows a divergence; while service sector costs hit a 12-month high due to wage growth, manufacturing input costs have cooled to a six-month low due to lower energy prices and reduced supply chain pressures. PMIs, or Purchasing Managers' Indices, illustrate these trends based on monthly surveys of company executives, where a value above 50 suggests growth, below 50 indicates decline, and the distance from 50 shows the magnitude of change. This data warns of the need for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to cautiously navigate further rate cuts in the current inflationary environment."

        "summary": "The article by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street examines the shifts in the yield curve before and after a recent Federal Reserve rate cut, focusing on why longer-term yields have risen post-cut. The section \"The Yield Curve Before & After the Rate Cut\" outlines that short-term Treasury yields have dropped due to Fed actions and expectations, while long-term yields and mortgage rates have seen an uptick, leading to a gradual un-inverting of the yield curve. In \"Why Have Longer-Term Yields Risen since the Rate Cut?\", it is explained that longer-term yields have increased due to several factors, including that numerous anticipated rate cuts are already priced into short-term yields. Additionally, inflation concerns have resurfaced as the Fed loosens monetary policy amidst a strong economy marked by high employment and robust consumer spending, prompting investors to adjust their pricing for longer-term securities. The section \"Already Priced in?\" elaborates on how short-term Treasury yields like the 3-month and 6-month have dropped in anticipation of near-term Fed rate cuts, while the 1-year and 2-year yields reflect expected rate cuts over a longer duration. Meanwhile, the 10-year yield has increased slightly, mirroring investors' long-term inflation expectations and Fed policy bets. Mortgage rates, tracking the 10-year yield, have also risen and experienced a wider spread during quantitative tightening, with this trend expected to continue. The article concludes by highlighting that mortgage rates closely follow the 10-year Treasury yield, and both have edged up since the Fed's rate cut, reflecting shifts in bond yields and future inflation uncertainties."

It notes a significant drop in the demand for existing homes, with sales falling to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.86 million, the lowest since the Housing Bust, despite a substantial decline in mortgage rates from 7.9% to 6.09% over the past ten months. This decline in demand is attributed to a buyers' strike, where potential homebuyers are holding off in hopes of securing lower prices, lower mortgage rates, and higher wages. Concurrently, supply has surged to its highest level for any August since 2018, with unsold inventory reaching its peak since October 2020 and supply now standing at 4.2 months. The rise in supply is driven in part by homeowners who, having kept their properties off the market during price spikes, are now listing them. Despite high median prices for single-family houses at $422,100 and condos at $366,500, there have been recent declines or slow growth, signaling market softening. Additionally, properties are staying on the market longer, with the median number of days rising to 53, the highest since 2019. The article also suggests that sellers are pulling unsold homes off the market and relisting them later, impacting the metrics used to track market aggressiveness and selling speed."

        "summary": "In a detailed analysis by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET, Fannie Mae reveals a pessimistic outlook on home sales, forecasting that the current buyers' strike will persist despite a significant drop in mortgage rates and an increase in listings. According to Fannie Mae's Economic & Strategic Research group, mortgage rates plummeted from 7.9% to 6.15%, but this reduction hasn't been enough to jumpstart the housing market. Buyers are holding out for even lower rates, better home prices, and higher wages, signaling that the current conditions are inadequate for a substantial rebound in home sales. The Economic & Strategic Research group further predicts that 2024 will witness the fewest existing home sales since 1995, even with the expected average rate for next year being 5.9%, a notable decrease from 7.9% in November 2023. This forecast is in sync with trends in the 10-year Treasury yield and expected Federal Reserve rate cuts. Existing home sales are anticipated to decline by 0.3% in 2024 compared to 2023, mirroring data from the National Association of Realtors which shows a 2.0% year-to-date drop. Despite the lower rates, mortgage applications have drastically fallen due to persistently high prices, with current application levels significantly lower than those in 2019 and 2021. Overall, demand remains suppressed as potential buyers wait for improved affordability, reduced rates, and higher incomes."

Despite these reductions, the longer-term rate target has been adjusted upwards to 2.9%. Quantitative tightening measures continue despite recent rate adjustments. Authored by Wolf Richter, the article details that the Federal Open Market Committee members voted for the rate cut following a period of stability, influenced by recent labor market data, speeches from Fed officials and Chair Jerome Powell, and inflation trends. Michelle Bowman dissented, preferring a 25 basis point cut. Key rates adjustments include the federal funds rate (4.75%-5.0%), interest on reserves (4.9%), overnight reverse repos (4.8%), overnight repos (5.0%), and the primary credit rate (5.0%). The section \"The 'dot plot'\" reveals that the FOMC\u2019s Summary of Economic Projections anticipates further cuts in 2024 to a median rate of 4.375%, and a decrease to 3.4% by the end of 2025, with the longer-run federal funds rate rising to 2.9%.

Despite falling prices for goods, highlighted in the section \"Price Drops in Goods Make Retail Sales Even Stronger,\" retail sales continued to grow, particularly in durable goods like used and new vehicles, bolstering inflation-adjusted retail sales. The CPI for durable goods has decreased, reflecting stronger real sales. According to the section \"Sales at the Largest Categories of Retailers,\" new and used vehicle dealers recovered from a ransomware hack, with notable increases in ecommerce and nonstore retail sales. Restaurants and bars saw resumed growth, while food and beverage store sales grew due to population increases. General merchandise sales also rose, whereas gas station sales fell as gasoline prices dropped. Building materials and hardware stores initially faced a downturn but recently rebounded, and clothing and accessory stores saw minor month-over-month declines but annual growth. Specialty and cannabis shops showed solid growth, further supporting the positive economic outlook."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter discusses the resurgence in used-vehicle unit sales, driven by much lower prices that have attracted more buyers into the market. The article's \"Used-Vehicle Unit Sales Jump\" section highlights an 8% increase in retail sales of used vehicles in August from July, reaching 1.68 million units, and a 14% rise year-over-year, based on Cox Automotive data. Factors contributing to this surge include a ransomware attack in June disrupting CDK's dealer management system, pushing sales processing into early July. The combined retail sales for June, July, and August saw a 5.7% year-over-year increase to 4.52 million units, outpacing the 2.8% rise in the first five months of the year. Although retail prices have fallen due to increased supply, tight inventories, especially of 2- and 3-year-old off-lease vehicles and trade-ins, present challenges, leading to a 3.3% year-over-year decline in certified pre-owned (CPO) sales in August, but an 11% increase from July. Wholesale auction prices also rose for the second consecutive month in August, signaling a potential end to the price decline trend, with retail prices giving up 60% of the 2020-2021 spike. New vehicle sales rebounded in August, reversing June's decline caused by the CDK ransomware attack, with cumulative sales for June, July, and August up 0.5% to 4.01 million units. The article concludes with anticipation of new retail sales data from the Census Bureau, which will reflect these dynamics in adjusted consumer spending figures."

In the section Money Market Funds, it is highlighted that MMF balances surged to $3.94 trillion by the end of Q2, driven by the attractiveness of higher yields compared to low-yield bank accounts. The total MMFs doubled since 2018 to $6.55 trillion, reflecting a significant shift in personal finance management. In the Large CDs section, banks were forced to increase deposit interest rates in 2022 and 2023 to compete with MMFs and T-Bills, with large time deposits rising nearly $1 trillion over two years before seeing a reduction when rates ceased increasing in mid-2023. Meanwhile, in Small CDs, smaller CD balances remained flat as interest rates stopped rising. The T-Bills section explains that the rise in Treasury bill investments also attracted funds away from traditional savings accounts, thanks to their higher yields. Overall, the article underscores the dynamic landscape of personal finance where Americans adjust their strategies based on interest rate fluctuations, constantly seeking higher returns on their cash."

        "summary": "According to a Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter, wholesale prices for used vehicles surged for the second consecutive month in August, potentially marking the end of the substantial deflation in this market segment. Driven by strong sales growth and tight inventories, this rise could influence the core Consumer Price Index (CPI), given the significant role used vehicle prices play in its calculation. The Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index indicated that auction prices for used vehicles across the US rose 1.2% in August from July, seasonally adjusted, with an unadjusted jump of 2.2%, suggesting a potential end to the dramatic price drops. Dealers, seeking to restock, are now bidding higher at auctions due to reduced supply from rental fleets, finance companies, and government fleets, which is expected to continue. Used vehicle retail sales have increased significantly year-over-year, signaling that higher auction prices will eventually impact the used-vehicle CPI. The 55% surge in used-vehicle CPI from mid-2020 through early 2022 substantially contributed to core CPI inflation, but this was followed by a significant decline since mid-2022. While wholesale price increases precede retail price changes by a few months, indicating recent drops in the used-vehicle CPI helped reduce core CPI, rising wholesale prices suggest a potential reversal soon. Retail inventories of used vehicles have dropped to 2.17 million by July, down from over 2.8 million pre-pandemic levels, primarily due to fewer maturing new leases. Preliminary August reports indicate a further contraction in inventories, suggesting an end to retail price declines amid strong sales and tight supplies. Wholesale prices for electric vehicles (EVs) spiked by 5.1% from July, while internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle prices rose by 2.0%. Despite significant price drops, EV prices have remained higher than ICE vehicle prices since mid-2021. Since January 2020, EV wholesale prices are up 70%, compared to a 35% increase for ICE vehicles. However, EVs represent a small portion of total auction sales, so their impact on the price index is minimal. The overall auction price index has risen 35.5% since 2020, with EV prices up 70.2% and ICE-vehicle prices up 34.6%."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter discusses the recent behaviors of the Treasury yield curve and its implications for predicting recessions in its sections: \"The Yield Curve\u2019s Steep Inversion, now Partial Un-inversion, the Sag in the Middle, and its Predictions of Recessions.\" The yield curve's inversion and recent partial un-inversions have been closely monitored due to their historical correlation with economic recessions, though its track record over the past 25 years shows mixed results, with four recession predictions, two of which were false alarms. The latest jobs report indicating deteriorating job creation contributed to a drop in yields across various maturities, with the largest declines in 1-year and 2-year yields, suggesting market expectations of multiple Fed rate cuts despite the current policy rates. Significant yield drops since July, especially in short-term maturities, led to a partial un-inversion between the 2-year and 10-year yields, yet the yield curve remains heavily inverted, particularly between the 3-month and 10-year yields, which shows a steep negative spread. The partial un-inversion, where the 2-year yield fell faster than the 10-year yield, resulting in a positive spread of 6 basis points, mirrors brief historical precedents in 2019 and 1998, which did not lead to immediate recessions. However, the ongoing steep inversion at the short-end indicates the yield curve is far from \u201cnormal.\u201d Given the distortions in the Treasury market caused by Federal Reserve policies like quantitative easing (QE) and quantitative tightening (QT), the yield curve's utility as a recession predictor is questioned, particularly as it displayed anomalous behaviors during rate cuts and QE interventions in 2019 without leading to a recession. Hence, caution is advised in over-relying on yield curve movements to forecast economic downturns."

Mag 7 Down $2.5 Trillion from Peak, Nasdaq Bloodied, Semis Crushed,\" explores the recent drastic downturn in stock prices, with a particular focus on major technology companies. It highlights that a mere 4% drop could push the Nasdaq back to its November 2021 levels, emphasizing the market's current volatility. Companies like Amazon, Tesla, and Alphabet have seen their stock values revert to levels from three to four years ago, while Nvidia has declined by 24% from its peak. The combined market value loss for key tech stocks, referred to as the Mag-7, stands at $2.5 trillion from their peak valuations, severely affecting the broader stock market. The article notes the anticipation of rate cuts beginning on September 18 but points out that the stock market has already shown significant weaknesses. The S&P 500 experienced a 1.7% decline in one day, marking a 4.2% drop for the week\u2014the steepest since March 2023\u2014and remains 4.6% lower than its mid-July peak. The Nasdaq Composite plunged 2.6% in a day and has dropped 10.5% since July 10, nearing 2021 levels. The semiconductor sector suffered severe losses, with the VanEck Semiconductor ETF falling 11.7% in a week and 23.6% from its recent peak. The Russell 2000 index also declined 5.7% for the week, returning to levels seen in January 2021. The Mag-7, which includes major tech stocks like Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, and Tesla, collectively shed 6.1% for the week, with a notable $2.54 trillion loss in market value over the past two months. Specific declines were particularly steep for Nvidia and Tesla from their respective peaks."

        "summary": "The article \"The Fed Has Room to Cut, Rates Are High Relative to Inflation, and Job Growth Could Use some Juicing Up\" by Wolf Richter on Wolf Street examines current labor market trends amidst economic adjustments. Reporting under the section \"Payrolls at employers increased by 142,000 jobs in August,\" Richter highlights a rebound in job growth with the highest gain since May and a revised increase from 89,000 in July, impacted by Hurricane Beryl. Despite the uptick, the three-month average job growth remains at 116,000, a level relatively weak but still better than the lowest points in 2018 and 2019. In \"The Fed\u2019s rates are high, inflation has dropped, and the labor market could use some juicing up,\" the article discusses how high policy rates by the Federal Reserve have effectively controlled inflation but have concurrently slowed job creation, posing a challenge for new immigrants entering the labor market and causing a slight uptick in unemployment. It notes that while layoffs are low, suggesting companies are not broadly cutting jobs, the labor market's inability to grow rapidly enough to accommodate new workers is problematic. Given that policy rates are significantly above inflation and with hourly earnings rising without sparking substantial inflation, there is room for the Federal Reserve to cut rates to stimulate job growth and support the labor market."

        "summary": "In the Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter, it is highlighted that the Federal Reserve's balance sheet reduction through Quantitative Tightening (QT) hit a significant milestone in August, with a $66 billion decrease bringing the total to $7.11 trillion, a level last seen in June 2020. The article notes that the Fed has managed to shed 38% of the assets accumulated during the pandemic-driven Quantitative Easing (QE) period, with a total reduction from the peak amounting to $1.85 trillion. According to the section \"QT by category,\" August saw a $25 billion reduction in Treasury securities and an $18 billion decrease in Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS), with the latter's reductions accelerating to $18 billion per month recently due to increased refinancing applications. The \"Bank liquidity facilities\" section discusses the current balances of the Discount Window and Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), noting that the Discount Window's balance has significantly reduced from a peak of $153 billion to $1.5 billion, and the BTFP balance is set to drop to zero by March 2025 due to the program's expiration. Lastly, the section \"What else caused total assets on the balance sheet to drop?\" explains that another $13.4 billion reduction was due to adjustments in \"other assets\" and \"unamortized premiums,\" reflecting the Federal Reserve's practices of destroying money from received payments and amortizing bond purchase premiums. Overall, the Fed's strategic QT efforts are successfully reducing the balance sheet without market disruptions, aiming to avoid issues similar to the September 2019 repo market crisis."

Listings Surge, Home Sellers Slowly Drop Prices\" on Wolf Street by Wolf Richter, it is highlighted that the housing market experienced a significant slowdown in August, as both buyers and sellers waited for lower mortgage rates. Despite these lower rates, buyers' strike persisted, causing listing prices to drop year-over-year in several cities like Miami (-11.7%), San Diego (-9.1%), Kansas City (-8.5%), San Francisco (-7.7%), and Austin (-7.6%). Realtor.com reported continued declines in listing prices, increased price reductions, a surge in active listings, and longer days on the market. Pending sales in July hit their lowest level since 2001, with August sales expected to be similarly weak. The median listing price fell for the second consecutive month, but many sellers still hold high price expectations, leading to market stagnation. Among the 50 largest metropolitan areas, Miami and San Diego had the steepest year-over-year declines in median listing prices. August saw a high number of price reductions, yet buyer interest remained low, indicating excessively high current prices. Active listings surged to 909,300, the highest since May 2020, driven by collapsed demand at prevailing prices. The highest increases in active listings occurred in Tampa and San Diego. Unsold properties' median days on the market rose to 53 days, the longest for any August since 2019, reflecting sellers' reluctance to lower prices and their readiness to pull properties off the market to avoid prolonged listing periods. This situation underscores a significant mismatch between pricing and buyer willingness."

What Even Is 'Normal?'\", delves into the current state of the labor market, which appears to be normalizing with fewer job quits and historically low layoffs. In the \"In July\" section, it is reported that non-seasonally adjusted job openings rose by 720,000 to 8.34 million, yet after seasonal adjustments, the figure drops to 7.67 million. This overall trend shows a decrease in job openings from peak labor shortages but still higher than pre-pandemic levels. \"What is normal?\" explores the job openings to nonfarm employment ratio, which dipped to 4.9%, still higher than pre-pandemic conditions. The article also highlights that the ratio of unemployed persons per job opening stands at 0.93, showing a more sufficient supply of labor due to over 6 million immigrants from 2022-2024. Despite this, layoffs and discharges, recorded at 1.76 million in July, remain historically low as employers retain workers, a behavior termed as \"hoarding\". Voluntary quits slightly increased to 3.28 million in July, but the three-month average dipped to 3.30 million, indicating stability in the job market as fewer people change jobs. Hires rose to 5.52 million in July, and the combination of fewer voluntary quits, low layoffs, and slower job creation results in less hiring, marking a potential new normal for hiring rates."

Nvidia experienced a notable stock drop of 11.7% following news of a DOJ subpoena related to an antitrust investigation, leading to a $342 billion decrease in market capitalization, the largest single-day loss for any company. This decline contributed to Nvidia's market cap plunging to approximately half of Tesla's market cap. Prominent companies in the semiconductor sector, such as Intel, AMD, and Broadcom, also saw considerable stock declines, ranging from 5.8% to 9.5%. Consequently, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF and the PHLX Semiconductor Index experienced their steepest one-day drops since the market crash of March 2020. The broader market was affected, with the Nasdaq Composite falling by 3.3% and approaching November 2021 levels if it drops another 6.7%, and the S&P 500 down by 2.1%. Despite the substantial declines, there was no specific economic news triggering the drop; rather, it was part of a broader market trend where investors' heavy stock exposure and optimistic expectations about continuous price rises create market vulnerability during selling pressures. The article by Wolf Richter suggests that this exuberance is reminiscent of the Dotcom Bust era, although current investors seem to dismiss the likelihood of a similar downturn."

        "summary": "In a recent Wolf Street article, Wolf Richter reports that the majority of construction spending has been directed towards nonresidential projects, significantly focusing on factory construction. This boom has resulted in total construction spending reaching a record $199 billion in July, marking a 7.5% increase from the previous year. Both residential and nonresidential sectors contributed to this rise, with the seasonally adjusted annual rate peaking at $2.16 trillion, representing a 6.7% year-over-year increase. Historically, construction spending saw a 35% decline from 2007 to 2011, primarily due to the Housing Bust. Nonresidential construction spending, which constitutes 56% of the total, hit a record $109 billion in July, increasing by 6.1% from last year. This sector's annual rate, though slightly dipping, remained strong at $1.21 trillion, largely driven by a two-year 45% spike in investments in manufacturing plants and inflation. Spending on manufacturing plants alone set a new benchmark at $237 billion annually, spurred by high-value sectors like semiconductor and EV plants. Factory construction now accounts for a record 19.6% of nonresidential spending, doubling over the past four years. In the segment analysis, manufacturing saw significant growth, while commercial construction fell by 13.3%, and other sectors like power and water supply experienced double-digit increases. The inflation impact on nonresidential construction spending has largely moderated since early 2023. The section **\"Digging out of the slump: residential construction\"** reveals that residential construction has rebounded from its mid-2022 slump, reaching a record $90 billion in July, a 9.1% year-over-year increase. The seasonally adjusted annual rate fell to $952 billion, driven mainly by a surge in multifamily construction, which hit multi-decade highs in 2021, 2022, and 2023. Despite these gains, residential spending still lags behind the robust growth in the nonresidential sector."

Since 2017, the series \"The Most Splendid Housing Bubbles in America\" has monitored home price inflation influenced by the Federal Reserve's interest rate policies. The series highlighted home price surges due to near-zero interest rates from 2020 to mid-2022, driven by cheap mortgages. Wolf Street identified three main limitations of the Case-Shiller data: its coverage of only 20 metros, a 3-4 month data publication lag, and its use of index values instead of actual dollar prices, making it less suitable for current market analysis. The Case-Shiller index, published by S&P Global, was historically valuable but has not expanded or improved in timeliness. The article introduces the \u201craw\u201d Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) as a replacement. ZHVI draws from millions of data points, including historical prices, MLS, brokerages, and households, and accounts for both off-market and for-sale-by-owner deals. Unlike Zillow's forward-looking estimates, ZHVI is a backward-looking index responsive to market changes, albeit more volatile. It is analyzed by Census Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and focuses on \"typical homes,\" including single-family houses and condos. An example from the Austin MSA shows a 0.4% decline in \"typical home value\" to $460,000 in July, reflecting a 4.6% year-over-year decrease and an 18.9% drop from the June 2022 peak. The Case-Shiller index, which does not cover Austin, lacks price visibility and its data will be available later.\n"

The annualized growth rate for the past three months was 4.8%, while year-over-year growth was 2.7%. Spending on durable goods surged by 1.7% in July, achieving an annualized growth rate of 16.8%, and spending on non-durable goods grew by 0.24%, maintaining a robust annualized growth rate of 4.4%. Despite earlier predictions, durable goods spending has surpassed pre-pandemic trends. Spending on services, which make up 65.5% of total consumer spending, rose by 0.20% in July and 2.9% year-over-year, though it has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels. Consequently, these spending behaviors have bolstered the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow forecast for Q3 GDP growth to 2.5%. In the section \"Where did our Drunken Sailors get this money?\", the article highlights that personal income excluding transfer receipts, adjusted for inflation, rose by 0.16% in July from June, with a three-month average increase of 0.22% and a year-over-year growth of 1.7%. This reflects growth in employment, wages, and dividend and interest incomes. Disposable income, adjusted for inflation, grew by 0.11% in July from June and by 1.1% year-over-year, maintaining positive growth for 19 consecutive months. Despite this income growth, the savings rate dipped to 2.9%, as Americans spent less than they earned but still managed to save at a slower pace, driven by confidence from rising home and asset prices."

Tax Receipts, GDP, and Inflation: Q2 Update\" by Wolf Richter discusses the growing concern of interest payments on the US national debt, emphasizing the increasing burden on tax receipts. The piece explains that an ever-growing portion of tax revenue is being directed towards debt servicing, limiting the government's financial flexibility and potentially leading to higher taxes or reduced services. In Q2, federal tax receipts rose by $69 billion, a 10.2% increase year-over-year, whereas interest payments surged by $45 billion, a 20% jump, hitting $272 billion. This trend can be linked to factors like inflation, employment growth, and wage increases, which reversed the decline seen in 2022 due to poor investment returns. The \"Interest payments as % of tax receipts\" section highlights that this ratio hit 36.3%, the highest since 1997, previously reaching crisis levels between 1982 and 1997. The section \"Interest payments have surged for three reasons\" attributes the surge to increased total debt at $35.3 trillion, replacement of older, lower-rate Treasury securities with higher-rate ones, and a rise in short-term Treasury bills from $4 trillion to $6 trillion. These factors combined have raised the average interest rate to 3.33%. In the \"Other measures of the burden of the debt\" segment, the article notes that interest payments as a percentage of GDP slightly dipped to 3.8% in Q2, the second highest since 1998. The debt-to-GDP ratio decreased to 121.6%, however, this reversed in Q2 2023 as the GDP grew slower than the national debt. Historically, the ratio surged from 63% to 100% between 2008 and 2012 due to economic crisis measures, and currently stands at 121.6%, highlighting ongoing debt accumulation. This comprehensive analysis underscores the long-term fiscal challenges facing the US."

This involves increasing short-term Treasury bill issuances and conducting bond buybacks, effectively swapping older long-term securities with new issues, which is not categorized as quantitative easing (QE). The shift to Treasury bills highlights the increased reliance on short-term debt, with T-bill yields soaring above 5% since mid-2023, surpassing the 10-year yield. This approach, more costly upfront, aims to stimulate the economy by reducing long-term borrowing costs, though it contradicts the Federal Reserve's policy of tightening rates to control inflation. Since the debt ceiling suspension in June 2023, T-bill issuances surged by $2 trillion, bringing their share of total marketable Treasury securities from 16.7% to 22.5% by May 2024. The buybacks, which began in April and intensified to weekly amounts between $2 billion and $4 billion, allow older securities to be retired and replaced without drastic price cuts. In one recent buyback, the Treasury repurchased a 1.25% 20-year bond at only 65.64 cents on the dollar, resulting in significant investor losses but stabilizing bond prices. While these moves potentially ease financial conditions and boost economic activity, they add inflationary pressures, complicating the Fed's objectives."

        "summary": "The article \"The Most Splendid Housing Bubbles in America, Aug 2024 Update: Prices Decelerate,\" by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street, provides an August 2024 update on housing prices across major US cities, revealing notable regional disparities. The section \"Below 2022 Peak: San Francisco, Phoenix, Seattle, Portland, Denver, Dallas, Las Vegas\" identifies a deceleration in housing prices in these seven key metropolitan areas. Specifically, San Francisco Bay Area experienced a 7.0% decrease from its May 2022 peak, Phoenix saw a 4.2% drop from June 2022, and Seattle and Portland both declined by 4.0% and 2.9% from May 2022 peaks. Denver and Dallas prices fell by 2.6% and 1.9% from May and June 2022 peaks, and Las Vegas saw a 0.4% decrease from July 2022. The next section, \"The Most Splendid Housing Bubbles by Metropolitan Area,\" utilizes the Case-Shiller Index to illustrate that single-family house prices in San Francisco remained unchanged month-to-month but increased 4.3% year-over-year, while condo prices slightly declined month-to-month but were up 1.0% year-over-year. Seattle noted a 0.6% month-to-month increase leading to a 6.7% year-over-year rise, and Phoenix experienced a 0.4% monthly increase and a 3.7% yearly gain. Ports on Denver, and Dallas had modest month-to-month gains along with low single-digit year-over-year increases, whereas Las Vegas showed a significant 1.2% monthly rise and an 8.6% yearly increase. The article further mentions Tampa, San Diego, Los Angeles, Washington DC, Boston, Miami, and New York all reaching record price highs, with substantial year-over-year growth rates ranging from 3.1% in Tampa to 9.0% in New York. To qualify as \"Most Splendid Housing Bubbles,\" metros must have experienced home-price inflation of 200% or more since 2000, with San Diego leading at 349%, followed by Los Angeles and Miami, while Chicago, with a 109% price increase since 2000, does not meet this threshold. The Case-Shiller Index methodology involved compares sales pairs over time and incorporates various adjustments."

        "summary": "Manufacturing orders have shown resilience with new highs reached in 2024 following a minor dip in 2023 after the pandemic boom, indicating ongoing demand in various sectors. According to Wolf Richter from Wolf Street, new orders for durable goods in July rose by 9.9% from June, reversing the prior month\u2019s decrease caused by nondefense aircraft order cancellations at Boeing. Orders excluding Nondefense Aircraft & Parts fell by 0.6% from June\u2019s record high. For durable goods orders excluding both defense and nondefense aircraft, there was a 0.6% decrease in July from June\u2019s record, reflecting a milder slowdown in the latter half of 2023 before a recovery. Defense orders represented about 5.5% of total durable goods orders over the past year. The order backlog surged during the pandemic due to component shortages, particularly semiconductors, but most of these shortages have now resolved. Nonetheless, aircraft manufacturers still face parts shortages, leaving many planes incomplete, leading to a significant backlog for Nondefense Aircraft & Parts, while the overall backlog excluding these parts dipped in mid-2023 but grew slightly again in June and July. In the section about manufacturing orders by the largest categories of durable goods, orders for motor vehicles and parts hit new records in 2024 with a slight dip in July to $63.6 billion, marking a 1.9% year-over-year increase and 19% above 2019 levels. Machinery orders stabilized at $37.6 billion in July, 17% higher than in 2019. Fabricated metal products orders plateaued at $36.2 billion for four months, up 13% from 2019. Computers and electronic products orders reached a 14-year high at $25 billion in June and maintained that level in July, 2.5% above previous years and 11% higher than in 2019. The \"other\" durable goods category remained around $48 billion since late 2022, showing a 22% increase from 2019."

        "summary": "In an article from Wolf Street, the common claim that \"half of Americans have less than $500 in savings\" is debunked as clickbait, misrepresenting the reality that many individuals choose not to use traditional savings accounts, instead favoring checking accounts, brokerage accounts, or financial vehicles like money market funds, CDs, stocks, bonds, and 401ks. In the section \"The Data Mess,\" the article highlights that studies from sources such as the Federal Reserve reveal a more nuanced picture: only 13% of Americans cannot cover a $400 emergency, and 54% have at least three months of expenses accessible, albeit not necessarily in a savings account. This misleading headline creates misconceptions that overshadow the detailed financial behaviors reported in comprehensive studies. Moving to \"Markets, Interest Rates & Inflation,\" the article discusses the economic trends impacting financial behaviors, while \"There\u2019s Still No Recession; Risks of Financialization & Overleverage\" delves into the ongoing debate about recession risks and the consequences of financialization and overleverage, emphasizing the importance of understanding the broader economic context."

        "summary": "In the article \"The Rate Cuts Powell Dangled in Front of Markets May Slam into Inflationary Fiscal & Economic Policies of Whoever Is in the White House Next Year\" by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at future rate cuts, although the timing will depend on incoming data and the evolving economic outlook. While no specific mention was made of a September cut, markets anticipate a move backed by signals from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes. Powell noted that inflation has cooled and the labor market has moderated without significant layoffs. The Fed aims for a gradual approach to rate cuts but may opt for substantial cuts if the labor market weakens considerably. Upcoming economic reports, especially the August jobs report, will be crucial for the Fed's decisions. High market expectations for several rate cuts could be affected by inflationary pressures from future government policies, with the upcoming presidential election playing a significant role in the Fed's rate strategies depending on the winning candidate. Meanwhile in the Treasury market, the August 2 jobs report influenced movements, with yields rising slightly. Powell's speech didn't change expectations much, as a September rate cut was already priced in. The six-month Treasury yield dropped to 4.88% post-jobs report but settled at 4.92%, reflecting a misjudgment of early 2024 rate cuts. The one-year Treasury yield remained at 4.36%, slightly up from an August 2 low of 4.33%, factoring in anticipated cuts within its one-year outlook."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article titled \"Inventory of New Completed Houses Surges to Highest since 2009, Triple from 2 Years Ago, Exactly What\u2019s Needed to Bring Down Prices across the Housing Market\" by Wolf Richter describes the recent surge in new house sales and its implications for the U.S. housing market. The inventory of completed new houses reached 99,000 in July, the highest since 2009 and about three times that during the price spike era from March 2021 to June 2022. Homebuilders, motivated to quickly sell these houses, are offering incentives and mortgage-rate buydowns, contributing to lower prices across the market. Total house inventories remained around 466,000 for three months, with a 7.3-month supply due to a sales uptick. In July, 64,000 houses were sold, marking increases from the previous year and pre-pandemic 2019, as builders capitalized on homeowners' high price expectations while seeing strong sales of new homes despite a decline in existing home sales. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of new house sales climbed to 739,000, the highest since May 2023. Builders, needing to sustain revenue, are compelled to build and sell houses continuously, contributing to the rising inventory of unsold completed houses which benefits the market but introduces risks. New house sales made up 20.7% of all house sales, the highest level since 2005, showing a shift as buyers opt for new houses over existing ones. This trend is highlighted in the section \"Homebuilders\u2019 sales take an ever-larger share from homeowners.\" The section \"Prices of new houses have dropped and are competitive with existing house prices\" explains that prices for new single-family homes have decreased since late 2022 as builders offer smaller, less elaborate homes and incentives like mortgage-rate buydowns, costing builders like Lennar an average of $47,100 per house. The median price of new houses in July was $418,300, lower than both the previous year and the 2022 peak, and roughly $10,000 less than the median price of existing single-family houses, which is expected to decrease seasonally for the rest of the year."

Despite a recent decline in mortgage rates to 6.5%, home sales are lagging, comparable to levels seen during the 2010 housing bust, largely due to high prices and low demand. Although July saw a 1.3% increase in sales from June, sales were still 19.1% lower compared to the previous year. Inventory has grown to 1.33 million homes, the highest level since October 2020, with a four-month supply available. Active listings have surged by 36.6% year-over-year, the highest since May 2020, with significant increases noted in cities like Tampa and San Diego. The median price of single-family homes dropped to $428,500 in July, showing a modest annual rise of 4.2%, while condo prices fell to $367,500 with a slower yearly growth rate of 2.7%, as increasing maintenance and insurance costs reduce their attractiveness."

Surging Refis to Speed Up the Fed\u2019s QT,\" by Wolf Richter explores the current cautious approach among homebuyers amidst declining mortgage rates. Despite rates falling to 6.50%, the lowest since May 2023, potential buyers are holding off on purchases, expecting further drops in both rates and home prices. Consequently, there has been a significant reduction in mortgage applications, with levels dropping to nearly half of their pre-pandemic numbers from 2019, nearing historic lows not seen since 1995, as highlighted in the section \"People are on Buyers\u2019 Strike, waiting for lower rates and lower prices.\" Meanwhile, housing inventory continues to grow as both regular buyers and institutional investors stay out of the market. Conversely, the section \"Mortgage refi applications spike will speed up the Fed\u2019s QT\" explains that refinancing applications have surged since early 2024, reaching levels not observed since April 2022, thus accelerating the Federal Reserve's quantitative tightening. This increase in refinancing activity helps speed up the runoff of mortgage-backed securities from the Fed's balance sheet, potentially increasing the QT pace to $20 billion a month from the current $14 billion, further anticipated by future home sales and mortgage payoffs."

This adjustment changes the average monthly payroll jobs added from 242,000 to 173,500, which, although lower than initially thought, still surpasses the 171,900 average monthly additions seen in 2018-2019. The reduction for April 2023 through March 2024 involved varied revisions across industries: private education and health services saw an upward revision of 87,000 jobs, transportation and warehousing increased by 56,400 jobs, while professional and business services and leisure and hospitality faced substantial downward revisions of 358,000 and 150,000 jobs respectively. Each year, the BLS aligns its employment estimates with state unemployment insurance tax records, and these preliminary revisions will be included in the final revisions due in February, which have historically differed significantly from the preliminary estimates.

In the main section, it is noted that the ECB\u2019s balance sheet has decreased by \u20ac2.39 trillion or 27% from its peak, now standing at \u20ac6.45 trillion, the lowest level since August 2020. This reduction surpasses the Fed's $1.78 trillion decrease, and together they have removed $4.44 trillion in QE liquidity. In the \"Loans and Bonds\" section, the ECB's QT program is detailed, showing a 96% reduction (\u20ac2.1 trillion) in loan holdings from their peak, with just \u20ac87 billion remaining, the lowest since 2005. The bond QT, which began rolling off in March 2023, has resulted in an 11% (\u20ac524 billion) reduction from peak holdings, now at \u20ac4.44 trillion. The ECB's loan QT involved Long-Term Refinancing Operations (LTRO) and Targeted LTROs (TLTROs), particularly during the pandemic, with almost nonexistent TLTRO III loans now. The bond QT process, governed by the Asset Purchase Programme (APP) and the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP), aims for a gradual, predictable removal of excess liquidity, averaging around \u20ac37 billion per month without causing major market disruptions."

        "summary": "Retail sales have been increasingly driven by ecommerce, while brick-and-mortar stores have stagnated over the past two years, despite categories like autos, gasoline, and food starting to feel the shift towards online purchasing. According to Wolf Richter for Wolf Street, ecommerce sales in Q2 rose significantly by 6.6% from Q2 2023 and 15.7% from Q2 2022, reaching $282 billion, while brick-and-mortar sales increased only by 1.0% year-over-year, totaling $1.85 trillion. Since the end of 2018, ecommerce sales have surged by 121.6%, whereas physical store sales have grown by just 28.6%. Although physical retail rebounded during 2021 and 2022, inflation has impacted growth, and since Q2 2022, brick-and-mortar sales have stagnated. Notably, Walmart reported a robust 22% year-over-year growth in ecommerce sales, highlighting a trend towards ecommerce's dominance. On a seasonally adjusted basis, ecommerce sales hit a record $292 billion in Q2, commanding 16.0% of total retail sales. Some stuff is still hard to sell online, such as gasoline and groceries, despite grocery sales being a significant portion of retail trade. Auto dealerships have seen a shift towards online sales, especially with used vehicles, and companies like Tesla are disrupting traditional dealership models by selling EVs directly to consumers online. The section \"Ecommerce did that\" highlights how ecommerce has heavily impacted traditional retail, with sectors like department stores and furniture retailers moving online. Department stores' contributions to retail sales have drastically dropped from 10% in 1992 to just 1.8% as of July, underscoring the transformative impact ecommerce has had on the retail industry."

Multifamily Jumped 45% from March Low despite CRE Depression\" for Wolf Street, Wolf Richter discusses the significant drop in July's single-family construction starts, largely attributed to Hurricane Beryl, resulting in a 14% decline\u2014the largest since the April 2020 lockdown. This contributed to an overall 6.8% decrease from June, marking the lowest level since May 2020. Despite this, multifamily housing starts surged by 11.7% in July, reflecting a 45% increase from their March lows, even amidst challenges like tight lending conditions and higher mortgage rates at 7%. Overall, residential construction starts are down 16% year-over-year, primarily due to the dip in single-family starts. The \"What we\u2019re worried about and what we\u2019re not worried about\" section emphasizes the slowdown in residential construction from 2021 and 2022 highs. Multifamily construction reached multidecade highs, raising concerns about overbuilding, as many new high-end units enter the market. Despite the broader downturn in commercial real estate, there are signs that multifamily construction might have stabilized in the spring. Single-family home construction, while cooling from its prior pace, remains solid year-to-date through June, performing above pre-pandemic levels and likely to continue this trend."

In July, retail sales increased by 1.0% from June and 4.0% year-over-year, totaling $724 billion, driven by a 1.0% rise in e-commerce from June and a 7.4% increase year-over-year, making it a major growth contributor. The section \"Big price drops in goods make these retail sales even stronger\" details how declining goods prices have led to stronger retail sales since consumers are purchasing more at lower prices, enhancing consumer spending and GDP growth. The \"Sales at the largest categories of retailers\" section highlights varied performances among different retail categories. New and used vehicle dealers saw a partial recovery in July with a 0.4% increase despite having flat dollar sales over the past 18 months due to dropping prices. E-commerce and nonstore retailers, making up 17% of retail sales, saw a 1.0% monthly increase and a 7.4% year-over-year rise. Food services and drinking places demonstrated slow growth over the past four months with a 0.2% increase from the prior month and a 4.1% year-over-year rise. Food and beverage stores noted a 0.4% increase from the prior month and a 2.3% increase year-over-year, while general merchandise stores experienced a 0.3% rise from the prior month and 3.3% year-over-year growth. Gas stations saw a 1.3% decline from the prior month but a 0.9% year-over-year increase, whereas building materials, garden supply, and equipment stores reported a 0.6% monthly increase but a 1.5% year-over-year decline as the post-pandemic remodeling boom waned. Overall, the article underscores robust consumer spending across various retail categories, influenced by factors like price changes, population growth, and specific market conditions."

        "summary": "The article \"Most Splendid Housing Bubbles in Canada, July 2024\" from Wolf Street provides a detailed analysis of various regional housing markets in Canada, including Toronto, Vancouver, Victoria, Ottawa, Calgary, Montreal, Edmonton, Quebec, and Winnipeg. In July 2024, Toronto experienced a significant drop in single-family home prices by 15% from their peak, with condo prices reaching multiyear lows. In contrast, cities like Calgary and Quebec City saw new highs in their housing markets. Despite the variations, the Canadian housing market is generally pausing, even after two recent interest rate cuts. According to Wolf Richter, home sales in Canada decreased by 0.7% from June to July and are still about 10% below the 10-year average, even with Bank of Canada rate cuts. The sales drop in Calgary and Greater Toronto Area was offset by increases in Edmonton and Hamilton-Burlington, with sales up 4.8% compared to July of the previous year. New listings rose by 0.9% in July, marking the sixth increase in seven months, and were up 22.7% year-over-year but still around 10% below historical averages. Both supply and demand for homes are approximately 10% below the 10-year averages. The Canada MLS Home Price Index for single-family homes saw a slight month-to-month increase of 0.1%, though it was down 4.1% year-over-year and 14.7% from the February 2022 peak, with regional price trends showing mixed results."

In the section \"Beneath the Skin of CPI Inflation,\" it is noted that housing CPI saw a resurgence after June's anomaly, contributing to broader month-to-month CPI acceleration. \"Services CPI Bounces Back from Outlier\" discusses how Core Services CPI, comprising 65% of total CPI, rose by 0.31%, while Durable Goods CPI's decline slowed. \"Month-to-Month Basis\" highlights a rise in Core CPI by 0.17%, driven by core services, while food-at-home CPI increased by 0.13%, and energy prices remained stable. The \"Year-Over-Year Basis\" section reports a 4.9% rise in Core Services CPI, a 4.1% drop in Durable Goods CPI, and a 3.2% increase in Core CPI, while overall CPI rose by 2.9%. \"Core CPI, Month-to-Month\" notes the 0.17% increase in July, driven by core services. The \"Core Services CPI Bounced Back from Outliers\" section mentions a 3.8% annualized increase, with a six-month deceleration to 4.2%. The \"Housing Components of Core Services CPI\" emphasizes a 6.0% annualized rise in Rent CPI and a 15.2% surge in vehicle insurance costs.

This change was driven by an extreme base effect from the previous year, July 2023, which saw unusually high figures replaced by much lower ones in 2024. This base effect sharply affected the year-over-year metrics, with the Services PPI increasing by only 2.6% in July compared to 3.5% in June. The Core Goods PPI remained stable, showing a slight annual increase around 2.2%. Going forward, the base effect is expected to reverse, impacting PPI metrics through the rest of 2024. The overall PPI for final demand decelerated, driven by a significant 1.9% drop in the Services PPI from June to July, although the PPI for finished core goods excluding food and energy products showed controlled, moderate acceleration. The Core PPI dipped by 0.6% from June to July, mainly due to the decline in Services PPI. This transition from a favorable base effect to a challenging one will continue influencing PPI readings moving forward."

Riley Financial's stock experienced a dramatic 52% drop in a single day, contributing to a total decline of 91% from its peak two and a half years ago. This decline was triggered by an unexpected announcement revealing substantial Q2 losses that exceeded the company's equity capital, alongside news of an expanding SEC investigation into the firm. Since allegations by short-sellers in February 2023, B. Riley has faced scrutiny over proper disclosure of asset risks and possible insider trading, particularly involving founder Bryant Riley and business partner Brian Kahn. The disclosed Q2 net loss ranged from $435 to $475 million, including significant write-downs and charges on investments, inventory impairments, and deferred income taxes. Additionally, the company revealed it has $2.16 billion in outstanding debt against $1.1 billion in total cash and investments. Formed in June 2014 via a reverse merger and listed on the Nasdaq in July 2015, B. Riley's stock had surged by 400% to $89 by the end of 2021 during the meme stock craze but has since plummeted to around $8 amid ongoing financial and regulatory challenges."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter provides an in-depth analysis of credit card delinquency rates and consumer financial health. The article starts by explaining the difference between the New York Federal Reserve's \"delinquency transition rates\" and month-end \"delinquency rates.\" While the former measures the percentage of balances transitioning into delinquency over the past 12 months, the latter reflects the level of delinquent balances at a specific point in time. Highlighting data points, the New York Fed's Q2 report showed that approximately 9.1% of credit card balances transitioned into delinquency, often misreported as a delinquency rate, whereas actual delinquency rates stood at 2.81% for bank cards, 4.44% for private-label cards, and 2.96% for credit cards at commercial banks. Remarkably, delinquency rates have dropped for the fourth consecutive month, with June figures from Equifax showing 2.83% for bank cards and 4.44% for private-label cards. The article discusses how credit card balances have surged by $27 billion or 2.4% in Q2, totaling $1.14 trillion, indicating robust consumer spending and rising prices. However, the growth in credit card and other consumer loan balances has been modest over the past two decades, with \"other\" loans increasing by 14% and credit card balances by 63%, despite a 73% rise in CPI inflation and 16% population growth. The relative burden of credit card and \"other\" balances on disposable income remains stable, accounting for 8.1%. Banks continue to show eagerness to open new accounts, with the total credit limit rising by $379 billion year-over-year to $4.92 trillion. Lastly, the article is part of a series that also covers auto loans, HELOCs, mortgage debt, and overall household debt, offering a comprehensive view of consumer credit for Q2."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter discusses the state of auto loans in the second quarter, emphasizing the steadiness of delinquency rates. In \"Auto Loans,\" it is noted that a significant number of consumers are paying cash for vehicles to eschew high-interest rates. The \"Burden of Auto Loans\" section reveals that the ratio of auto loan debt to household disposable income has dipped to 7.79%, the lowest since Q1 2021 and, excluding that period, the lowest since 2015 due to faster-growing disposable incomes. In the \"Subprime Lending\" section, subprime loans, now primarily linked with used vehicle financing, represent only 14% of new vehicle loan originations. The appeal of securitizing subprime auto loans into ABS has waned due to higher Treasury yields and increasing delinquency rates, causing financial distress and bankruptcies among specialized subprime dealer/lenders. The slight decrease in the subprime 60-plus day delinquency rate in June is overshadowed by elevated rates compared to the previous year. Meanwhile, prime loans maintain low delinquency rates below 0.3%. Lastly, the \"Delinquencies in Q2\" segment highlights that overall auto-loan delinquency rates have stabilized despite the upward pressure from subprime-related delinquencies. The total auto loan and lease balance for both new and used vehicles grew by only 0.6% in Q2, a modest 2.8% year-over-year increase, attributed to lower financing amounts and more cash transactions amid declining used-vehicle prices and reduced new vehicle prices."

Bumble Inc.'s Q2 earnings report in the WOLF STREET section detailed a downward revision of its revenue growth outlook to 1-2% from the previously expected 8-11%, leading to a historic drop in share prices. The company explained the adjustment as necessary for boosting user growth, customer value, and long-term revenue, with Bumble's own app revenue rising by 4.8% and Badoo's revenue declining by 2.2%, despite an increase in total paying users by 14% and a 9% decline in revenue per user. Bumble's net income saw an increase to $37.7 million for the quarter, although the company\u2019s shares have significantly fallen since their initial surge post-IPO in February 2021, landing Bumble on the \"Imploded Stocks\" list in March 2022 after substantial declines. Blackstone\u2019s initial investment in Bumble stemmed from its 2019 acquisition of a majority stake in MagicLab for $2 billion, a highly profitable move as it made about $4 billion through progressive share sales while the public watched share values decrease. Recent filings show Blackstone continues to divest, now holding approximately 50 million shares."

Mortgage balances saw a modest increase of $77 billion or 0.6%, driven by higher home prices and larger financed amounts, reaching $12.5 trillion. HELOC balances showed notable growth, climbing 1.1% for the quarter and 11.8% year-over-year to $380 billion, yet remain historically low compared to the past. Around 1.8 million HELOCs were initiated between 2023 and the first half of 2024, offering a cost-effective borrowing alternative but posing risks if heavily used during economic downturns. The burden of mortgage debt on households, measured against disposable income, has slightly decreased, maintaining around 60%\u2014a historically low ratio. Serious delinquencies in mortgage balances have dropped to 0.57%, while HELOC delinquencies hit their lowest levels since 2006 at 0.36%. Overall, 30-day mortgage delinquencies rose slightly to 3.3%, and HELOC delinquencies edged down to 2.1%. Foreclosures have stabilized, exhibiting a \"frying-pan\" pattern, with numbers below pre-pandemic levels and unlikely to become significant unless there is a major economic downturn. Low unemployment, bolstered by new labor force entrants, helps keep foreclosures in check, as homeowners with equity or those employed can avoid or manage mortgage defaults."

        "summary": "The article \"Used Car & Truck Prices Suddenly Bounce, Inventories Tighten: End of Historic Plunge that Pushed CPI Inflation Down?\" by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street discusses the recent uptick in used car and truck prices following a notable decline that had significantly contributed to reducing the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation. This price rebound is primarily due to tightening inventories, marked by a 25% decline in June from 2019 levels, and a slowdown in off-lease vehicle supplies expected to last until 2026. In July, Manheim's Used Vehicle Value Index reported a 2.8% seasonally adjusted increase, and wholesale prices saw an unusual 0.6% rise. This shift is in sharp contrast with typical price declines during this period. Notably, prices for both electric vehicles (EVs) and internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles increased, counter to the anticipated declines, though EV prices still have room to fall post-pandemic spike. Though the retail used vehicle CPI usually trails behind wholesale trends, it is expected to align with these auction price increases shortly. The upcoming Bureau of Labor Statistics' release of the July CPI will provide further insights into these evolving trends."

The \"Relative Burden of Household Debt\" section notes that household debt has become less burdensome as disposable income grew by 0.9% in Q2 2024, surpassing the 0.6% debt growth. This left household debt at 85.2% of disposable income, historically low compared to the Financial Crisis. In \"Delinquencies Still Lower than Normal, Barely Tick Up,\" delinquency rates experienced a minor increase to 3.95% for debts 30 days or more overdue, while the 90-day delinquency rate stayed at an unprecedented low of 1.83%, maintaining healthier financial health than pre-pandemic levels.

Inflation Pressures Still On.\" Wolf Richter reports that the ISM Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) and S&P\u2019s US Services PMI both indicated values above 50 in July, signaling growth with S&P\u2019s services PMI at 55.0, close to June\u2019s 55.3. This growth is attributed to solid new order increases and higher employment levels, benefiting from a shift in consumer spending from goods to services including travel, recreation, healthcare, and financial services. While input cost inflation rose due to higher wages and transportation costs, output inflation slightly decelerated. The service sector's expansion is expected to contribute to a 2.2% annualized GDP growth rate. The ISM Services PMI rose to 51.4% in July from 48.8% in June, indicating an increase in business activity, new orders, and exports.

        "summary": "The U.S. stock market opened into turmoil following Japan's market crash today, where the Nikkei 225 plunged 12.4% on Monday, contributing to a three-day decline of 19.6% after the Bank of Japan ended its free money policies. This marked a significant loss of 25.5% since its peak on July 10, erasing gains since the end of October. Major Japanese companies across sectors such as banks, insurers, and manufacturers experienced significant losses, and similar declines were seen in Korea's KOSPI index and Taiwan's TAIEX, mainly led by semiconductor stocks. In contrast, markets in India and Hong Kong incurred minor declines. European markets demonstrated less volatility with modest drops of around 2%. Initially, the U.S. markets experienced brief panic, especially in tech stocks, but began to stabilize with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq recovering from morning lows. The CBOE Volatility Index spiked reflecting the short-term panic before settling."

        "summary": "In the Wolf Street article \"Berkshire Dumped Nearly Half its Apple Shares plus Other Stocks into Final Burst of Rally, Bought T-Bills,\" it is highlighted that Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett, significantly reduced its holdings in Apple, selling nearly half of its shares during a market rally, alongside other stocks, signaling a potential market sell-off. This large-scale selling was more substantial than anticipated by Edward Jones Investments. In Q2 2024, as detailed in \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET,\" Berkshire continued its trend of net stock sales for the seventh consecutive quarter, divesting $76 billion and rapidly reallocating the proceeds into Treasury bills, which saw an $81 billion increase, coinciding with a market downturn. The section \"Cash is king\" reveals that Berkshire's T-bill holdings surged by $81 billion to $235 billion, earning $3 billion in interest income at a 5.3% average rate, thereby surpassing Warren Buffett's forecast of exceeding $200 billion in cash and T-bills by the end of Q2. The company's total cash, including T-bills and cash equivalents, reached $277 billion, more than doubling since Q1 2023. \"Ditching Stocks\" explains that Berkshire divested $75 billion in stocks in Q2, notably reducing its Apple holdings to 400 million shares and selling 8.8% of its Bank of America holdings, focusing its stock investments mainly in Apple, Bank of America, American Express, Coca-Cola, and Chevron. The \"Share buybacks grind down\" section notes a significant reduction in share buybacks to $345 million in Q2 from $2.57 billion in Q1, implying that Buffett may no longer see the shares as a good value following a 44% price surge in 2023. Finally, the \"Investment income drops, operating income rises\" section reports a 15% increase in operating income to $11.6 billion year-over-year, driven mainly by the insurance sector and GEICO's underwriting profits. However, investment income dropped by 28% to $18.7 billion in Q2, resulting in a 15% year-over-year decrease in net income to $30.3 billion."

        "summary": "Values of Old Office Towers Go to Near-Zero, but the Land Has Value: UBS Gets Off with Black Eye by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street details how UBS suffered a significant financial setback with a commercial office building in San Francisco as its value plummeted. Nonetheless, the land retained some value, partially offsetting the financial loss, reflecting a broader trend of declining office property values due to increased remote working. UBS purchased a 925,000-square-foot office building at 135 West 50th Street in Manhattan for $332 million in 2006 and later acquired the land beneath it for $279 million. In 2019, they sold the land to Safehold for $285 million while retaining a long-term lease on the building, anticipating high office rents. Despite investing $76 million in renovations completed in 2021, the building ended up only 35% leased as the office market suffered from remote work trends. Efforts to sell the building were unsuccessful, leading UBS to eventually sell it through an online auction for $8.5 million. Although the total returns from the property amounted to $293.5 million, depreciation rules softened the financial blow on UBS's balance sheet."

Mag 7 -$2.26 Trillion from Peak, Semis Crushed, Nasdaq Bloodied\" by Wolf Richter on Wolf Street addresses the recent downturn in the stock market driven by fluctuating hopes around Federal Reserve rate cuts. Initially, stock market enthusiasm since December 2023 was fueled by expectations of multiple rate cuts in 2024, leading to a significant market rally. However, on July 10, sentiment shifted as anticipated rate cuts did not materialize, causing stock prices to plunge. The \"Mag 7\" stocks\u2014Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla\u2014have collectively fallen $2.26 trillion from their peak valuations. Highlighting this, Amazon\u2019s shares dropped an additional 8.8% following disappointing earnings, contributing to a 16.5% decline since July 10. Intel suffered the most significant hit with a 26% plunge in its share price due to falling revenues and other financial challenges, marking its worst day since 1974. The article notes that since the yield curve inversion in 2022, recession predictions have persisted but have yet to materialize. The shift in market focus back to fundamentals revealed unsustainable valuations that had driven recent stock market peaks. Notably, the Magnificent 7 companies saw a sharp decline of 2.4% in a single day, equating to a loss of $369 billion. Over 17 trading days, their combined market capitalization dropped to $14.7 trillion, a 13.3% decrease from their July 10 peak. The semiconductor sector was particularly hard hit, with Intel's significant drop and the PHLX Semiconductor Index down 22% from its peak, although the index remains up 10% year-to-date. Despite recent sell-offs, the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 Index still show substantial gains year-to-date, underscoring that the market correction, driven by refocusing on economic fundamentals amidst Fed policy uncertainties, has not yet erased earlier advances."

        "summary": "The article \"Japanese Stocks Plunge, Yen Rises from the Ashes as BOJ Hikes, Ends Free Money, and Starts QT\" from Wolf Street, written by Wolf Richter, discusses the drastic decline of Japanese stocks, particularly the Nikkei 225 index, which dropped 8.2% over two days following the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) decision to raise interest rates and initiate quantitative tightening (QT). This marked the end of its zero-interest-rate policy, prompting the yen to strengthen after a historical low of \u00a5162 to USD in early July. Despite the sharp decline, the Nikkei 225 remains up 7.3% year-to-date and has experienced a 38% rise since early 2023. The section \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET\" details that this plunge, the most significant since March 2020, had reversed the gains from the past six and a half months. In \"Why suddenly?\" the article explains how foreign investments, particularly by Warren Buffett, drove a 62% surge in the Nikkei index earlier in the year before cooling off. The BOJ's policy rate hike to 0.25% and QT measures amid a core CPI of 2.6% in June underscored the tightening monetary environment. As investors sought safer assets amid the sell-off, longer-term Japanese Government Bond yields fell to 0.96%, highlighting erratic market reactions and the end of Japan\u2019s era of easy money."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article \"Growth in Jobs Slows to 2017-2019 Pace, Unemployment Rate Rises as Massive Wave of Immigrants Is Absorbed More Slowly\" by Wolf Richter discusses how wage growth has decelerated to pre-pandemic levels, aligning with the trends from 2017 to 2019. The increase in the unemployment rate is linked to the slower absorption of a large influx of immigrants into the labor market. Job growth has slowed, resembling the pace from 2017 to 2019. Payrolls increased by 114,000 in July, lower than in the previous months but still surpassing 2017-2019 levels, according to the ADP National Employment Report, which showed job growth of 122,000 for the month. The three-month average job growth is 170,000, slightly higher than the previous month and within the 2017-2019 range. Total employment hit a record 158.7 million as job growth returns to normal post-lockdown levels. Average hourly earnings rose by 2.8% annualized in July from June, a deceleration from earlier months but still within the 2017-2019 range. The three-month average annualized growth rate was 3.7%, at the upper end of the 2017-2019 range, while the 12-month rate fell to 3.6%, indicating wage growth normalization compared to 2022. The headline unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, reflecting an increase in the number of unemployed to 6.87 million due to the influx of new workers, including 6 million immigrants over the last two years. Despite the slowdown in job growth, payrolls continue to rise without signs of a recession, as highlighted by a 2.8% GDP growth in Q2 after slower growth in Q1."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter critiques the New York Times for misleadingly sensationalizing the sale of a 23-floor Manhattan office building, stating it sold at a 97.5% discount. The article argues that while the building's value has plummeted, the land still retains substantial worth, with UBS avoiding significant financial damage and suffering only reputational harm. In 2006, UBS acquired the Manhattan office tower for $332 million, and in 2019, they sold the land below the building to Safehold for $285 million, retaining the building through a ground lease with Safehold. Despite investing $76 million in renovations with hopes of rising office rents, the building's value declined due to market shifts and work-from-home trends, leading to reduced occupancy and revenue. By 2024, UBS struggled to sell the underperforming asset and eventually auctioned it for $8.5 million, resulting in a capital loss of roughly 28% from their initial and renovation investments. However, depreciation rules could mitigate the financial impact on their statements. The article highlights a broader real estate market trend, with a similar case in Chicago where an office building sold for a fraction of its initial investment after separating land and leasehold interests, emphasizing the declining value of buildings versus land. The New York Times inaccurately calculated the discount rate by only considering the building's sale proceeds without accounting for the land's value, leading to the false impression of an enormous discount and highlighting the need for accurate reporting and knowledgeable editing."

        "summary": "The article \"Eyepopping Factory Construction Boom in the US Reaches New Highs amid Big Corporate & Strategic Rethink\" by Wolf Richter on WOLF STREET discusses the substantial increase in factory construction in the U.S., fueled by corporate reevaluation post-pandemic. Companies invested a record $19.7 billion in June 2024 in new manufacturing facilities, mainly to reduce dependence on China and mitigate supply chain risks. This surge has been influenced by the CHIPS Act of 2022, although its funds are yet to be disbursed, and is part of a strategic shift focusing on high-value products like motor vehicles and semiconductors. The \"Inflation in construction has abated\" section notes that while construction costs had spiked from mid-2021 to 2022, they stabilized in early 2023, with the Producer Price Index for nonresidential buildings remaining flat or slightly negative since late 2023 after previously peaking at a 24% increase in mid-2022. Overall, the investment trend underscores the move towards local production capabilities and increased automation to counteract supply chain vulnerabilities."

In the section by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET, it is noted that market expectations for a 25-basis-point rate cut by September were high, but Powell, during a post-FOMC press conference, did not confirm these expectations. He stressed that future rate cuts would depend on inflation improvements or labor market declines, while high inflation and a stable economy might delay cuts. In Powell's own words, he elaborates on the balanced yet cautious strategy, highlighting the necessity of ongoing data assessment. While recent data improves confidence, the Fed is not yet ready to reduce the federal funds rate, as premature action could reverse inflation progress or an undue delay could weaken economic activity. Overall, Powell's stance is one of prudence, with decisions meticulously guided by economic indicators without making immediate rate cut commitments."

To combat the yen's prolonged depreciation and rising inflation, BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda announced a raise in the policy rate by 25 basis points to 0.25% and the commencement of quantitative tightening. Despite these measures, the real policy rate remains deeply negative as the new rate is still below the Core CPI of 2.6%. As part of the quantitative tightening strategy, the BOJ will reduce its holdings of Japanese Government Bonds at a gradual pace, eventually reaching a monthly runoff rate of about \u00a53 trillion by early 2026. This is notably slower compared to the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s QT approach. Although the BOJ's moves are more conservative, they have started to stabilize the yen, as evidenced by its recent appreciation against the U.S. dollar. Overall, while these steps are a cautious start and represent a shift in the right direction, they are considered insufficient to fully address the broader economic challenges."

This situation underscores the critical role of share buybacks, without which Conn\u2019s might have avoided its financial downfall. The company, which sold furniture, appliances, electronics, and mattresses across 552 stores, also operated as a subprime lender enabling high-risk customers to finance their purchases.

Conn's bankruptcy could have been avoided if it had not spent $345 million on share buybacks from 2016 to 2023, a move that depleted cash reserves and increased debt, ultimately hastening the company\u2019s collapse. In December 2023, Conn's further strained its finances by acquiring another struggling subprime retailer, W.S. Badcock, in an effort to mask a 23% revenue decline since 2015 amidst increased lending to subprime customers and rampant inflation. This acquisition led to the liquidation of both companies within seven months.

Discussing the relationship between the economy's size (GDP) and national debt, the article highlights that the debt-to-GDP ratio, although slightly dipping to 121.7% in Q2 2024 from its peak of 133% in Q2 2020, still has not returned to pre-pandemic levels. The ratio\u2019s erosion during recessions, due to rising debt and declining GDP, remains a concern, especially with predictions of worsening during future economic downturns. Notably, interest payments as a percentage of tax receipts have dipped due to increased tax revenues and are expected to decline further. In the \"T-bills' share of Treasury securities held by the public\" section, the article outlines that $5.76 trillion in Treasury bills are currently in circulation, and T-bills now account for 20.7% of the securities held by the public, a decrease from 22.5% in March. Out of the total $35 trillion Treasury securities, $7.16 trillion are held by government entities and $27.84 trillion by the public, including international investors and financial institutions."

According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, revisions raised May\u2019s annualized core PCE from 1.0% to 1.5%, while June's rate accelerated to 2.2%, driven by stable durable goods prices. Over six months, core PCE increased to 3.4%, exceeding the core CPI's 3.3% rise in June. The \"In summary, year-over-year\" section reports that the overall PCE price index, including food and energy, rose 2.5% year-over-year in June, with energy prices nearly flat and food prices unchanged over four months. The core PCE price index ascended 2.6%, above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, while core services PCE steadied at 3.9% after May's upward revision to 4.0%, consistent since December. The durable goods PCE price index fell 2.9% year-over-year, less than May's 3.1% drop, with the core services index's six-month average adjusted to 4.5%, higher than late 2023's range, indicating a re-accelerating economy with rising core services inflation impacting housing, healthcare, and transportation. The durable goods PCE index remained unchanged in June after a 9.1% annualized drop from April to May, reflecting tendencies for slight negative ranges in normal periods due to manufacturing efficiencies and globalization."

Attempts to manage its debt through extensions were unsuccessful, leading to bankruptcy. The company plans to continue operations with $60.5 million in Debtor in Possession financing while transitioning ownership. Insiders and early investors benefited from the SPAC merger, but public shareholders faced significant losses, highlighting the high risks associated with SPAC investments."

Our Drunken Sailors Splurge on Durable Goods, Investment Jumps, Federal Gov Undoes Blip\" on Wolf Street, Wolf Richter details the economic resurgence experienced in the second quarter. The US GDP, adjusted for inflation, increased at an annualized rate of 2.8% from Q1, doubling the 1.4% growth seen in Q1, exceeding the 14-year average of 2.2%. Consumer spending rose by 2.3%, with a notable 4.7% increase in durable goods expenditure, likened to \"drunken sailors\" due to robust expenditure despite higher interest rates. Gross private investment surged by 8.4%, driven by an 11.6% increase in equipment investment, although residential investment declined by 1.4%. Government consumption and investment grew by 3.1%, rebounding from a temporary Q1 decline. However, the trade deficit worsened as strong US demand for durable goods led to an increase in imports that negatively impacted GDP growth. Despite this, in current-dollar terms, the US economy's size rose to $28.6 trillion, with inventory changes positively contributing to Q2 GDP growth."

Among these, Nvidia registered the most significant drop, losing $512 billion, earning the title of the double-WTF chart of the year. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 also experienced notable declines of 3.65% and 2.3% respectively. However, these losses are modest compared to recent market gains. The Magnificent 7\u2014comprising Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla\u2014collectively fell by 4.8% in a single day and 10.4% from their recent peak, resulting in a sizable market cap reduction. Tesla experienced a particularly steep decline of 18.1% since July 10, which was largely blamed on Elon Musk's unpopular actions on his social media platform X. Additionally, Nvidia saw a 6.8% drop in just one day, raising concerns about the durability of its AI-fueled stock surge. Despite these declines, the overall market correction remains relatively mild percentage-wise, although the sheer scale of the dollar amounts has significantly impacted the broader indices."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter discusses how the prices of new houses have fallen below those of existing houses due to significantly increased inventory, reaching levels not seen since 2009. In the article's section \"Prices of new houses fall below prices of existing houses,\" it is noted that the median price for new homes is now lower than that of existing single-family houses, with builders offering lower-priced options and incentives like costly mortgage-rate buydowns. The three-month moving average of the median new home price has dropped to $412,667 as of June, slightly below the previous year and 6.7% below its peak. Builders face the challenge of aligning prices and construction schedules with fluctuating mortgage rates and market demands, with the key question being the rate at which new home prices will change relative to existing home prices in the latter half of the year. In the section \"Inventory piles up. Exactly what the housing market needs.,\" the article highlights that builders have increased their inventory to 475,000 houses, the highest since 2008, with a surge in supply pushing prices downward and making housing more affordable. This includes a peak inventory of completed houses reaching 98,000, showing builders' urgency to sell. The market benefits from this increased supply, providing better deals on new homes for buyers struggling with the existing home market. Despite reduced sales, builders remain committed to constructing houses and negotiating sales, ensuring ongoing market supply."

        "summary": "Wolf Richter's article on Wolf Street, titled \"Here Comes the Inventory of Vacant Homes: With Buyers on Strike despite Lower Mortgage Rates, Supply Spikes to Highest in 4 Years. Sales Drop Further except at High End,\" examines the dynamics of the housing market as potential buyers remain reluctant despite lower mortgage rates. The supply of vacant homes has surged to its highest level in four years, marking a shift from a seller's to a buyer's market, acknowledged by the National Association of Realtors (NAR). Despite mortgage rates dropping to around 6.8%, existing home sales have declined significantly, with a notable 5.4% drop in June both month-over-month and year-over-year. This decline has led to a substantial 23.4% year-over-year increase in inventory in June, with active listings spiking by 36.7% in various metro areas such as Tampa, Orlando, and Denver. Homes are also staying longer on the market, resulting in a rise in available inventory from 3.1 months the previous year to 4.1 months in June. Furthermore, 37.6% of active listings saw price reductions, the highest percentage for any June except June 2022. Despite the overall decline in home sales, the section \"Median price was shifted up by the surge in sales of high-end homes\" explains that the median home price has been pushed up due to an increase in high-end home sales, particularly those priced over $1 million. Sales in all other price categories decreased, with the largest drops in homes below $750,000. This trend was especially noted in expensive markets like the San Francisco Bay Area, driven by wealthy buyers often paying in cash, partly fueled by the AI boom and stock market gains. As a result, the median price of single-family homes hit a new high of $432,700, with the median condo price rising to a record $371,700. However, future large price accelerations are considered unlikely due to an approaching market balance."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter highlights the stark contrast between different sectors of the financial market. In the section \"CRE Gets Strangled,\" it is noted that commercial real estate is facing significant distress, with many properties struggling to refinance debt. The section \"Corporate Bankruptcies Highest since 2010\" reveals that corporate bankruptcies have soared to levels not seen since 2010, suggesting that many companies are grappling with tighter credit conditions and finding it difficult to manage their debt loads. Interestingly, the section \"Junk Bonds & Broad Financial Conditions in La-La-Land\" indicates that despite these troubling indicators, junk bonds and broader financial conditions appear unusually positive. High demand for BB-rated junk bonds has driven their yield spreads to their lowest point since 2007, signaling investor confidence in higher-rated junk debt. However, the lower end of the junk-bond market, particularly CCC-rated bonds, remains troubled with high yield spreads and rising bankruptcy rates. Leveraged loans have also seen an increase in distressed debt exchanges, where companies negotiate haircuts with lenders to avoid bankruptcies, still indicating significant financial distress. Despite these issues in specific areas, the Chicago Fed's National Financial Conditions Index shows that overall financial conditions have loosened to their most relaxed state since November 2021, despite the Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to tighten them. This divergence highlights a significant mismatch between the broader financial markets and the underlying economic challenges, particularly in commercial real estate and among companies with lower credit ratings."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article, \"Non-Tesla EV Sales +45% in Q2 YoY in California, Tesla -24%: People Have Had it with Musk\u2019s Bullshit about California and San Francisco?\", outlines a significant shift in California's electric vehicle (EV) landscape during the second quarter of 2023. Despite the overall EV market experiencing a slight decline of 1.3% year-over-year, non-Tesla EV sales surged by 45% to 49,232 vehicles, while Tesla's sales plummeted by 24% to 52,211. This shift is partly attributed to increasing consumer dissatisfaction with Elon Musk's controversial comments about California and San Francisco. Tesla\u2019s Model Y saw a 15% drop in sales, and Model 3 sales collapsed by 59%, partly due to rebate qualification issues; meanwhile, Cybertruck sales reached 3,048 units. In \"The auto market in California,\" the article notes that internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle sales dropped by 2.1%, and EVs managed to increase their market share to 21.9%. \"California sales matter for Tesla\" reveals that Q2 2023 California registrations represented 14.8% of Tesla\u2019s global deliveries. Without the 24% decline in California, Tesla\u2019s global deliveries would have only decreased by 1.4% rather than 4.8% year-over-year. In \"Musk\u2019s bullshit was funny until it whacked Tesla sales,\" the article criticizes Musk's history of controversial and financially impactful statements, including his forced Twitter purchase and the 2018 tweet about taking Tesla private, for which he faced SEC consequences. These antics, alongside Musk's comments about California, have provoked consumer backlash, similar to boycotts faced by other brands, leading to increased competition from various automakers and a rise in non-Tesla EV purchases. Consequently, Musk has alienated many former Tesla enthusiasts in California."

Despite a 1.1% rise from April to May and a 9.0% increase year-over-year, bringing foreign holdings to $8.13 trillion, the share of US debt held by foreign investors has decreased from 33% in 2015 to 22% in 2023. The article points out that foreign entities have increasingly invested in US Treasury securities, with the largest six financial centers, including the UK and Switzerland, seeing a 13.4% increase to $2.37 trillion. However, some holdings belong to US entities managed offshore. Japan, with $1.13 trillion, saw a 2.9% increase despite selling USD to support the yen, while China and Hong Kong\u2019s combined holdings decreased to $986 billion after a 7.3% drop. In contrast, Euro Area countries, primarily Belgium and Luxembourg, have significantly increased holdings to $1.60 trillion, a 14.8% rise year-over-year. The article also notes notable annual increases in the UK's holdings by 19.3% to $723 billion and Canada's by 33% to $354 billion, while Taiwan reached a record $263 billion with a 9.8% annual increase. Although India's holdings slightly decreased, they have multiplied sixfold since 2012, and Brazil\u2019s holdings have stabilized after previous cuts, now at $223 billion. The article delves into the implications of these trends, emphasizing the shift in foreign ownership dynamics and the possible economic risks of an expanding national debt."

This reluctance has led to a fall in applications for new home purchases, reaching their lowest levels since early June, indicating a continued buyers' strike. Despite this, refinancing activity has surged to its highest level since August 2022, as potential buyers wait for more affordable rates and home prices (\"Buyers' strike continues, prices are too high\"). Mortgage applications for purchasing homes have plummeted, showing a 47% decrease compared to 2019 and a 14% year-over-year decline, reflecting a low sales volume despite rising active listings and eager sellers reducing prices. Conversely, mortgage refinance applications, which collapsed in 2022 due to rising rates, are now trending upwards, with most current refinances being cash-out refinances, nearly doubling from November's low (\"Mortgage refi applications jump from collapsed levels\"). The Federal Reserve monitors these refinancing activities as they impact the pace of Quantitative Tightening (QT) related to its Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) holdings. An increase in refi activity leads to principals being repaid to MBS holders, hence reducing the Fed's MBS portfolio. Despite the recent uptick, refinance applications remain significantly lower than in previous years, showing a 66% drop from 2019 and an 81% drop from 2021, underscoring their inverse relationship with mortgage rates (\"As Fed watchers here\u2026\")."

The company, the largest mall landlord in the U.S., has downsized its portfolio of shopping centers by 38% since 2012 in response to the sector's deteriorating conditions. Recently, Simon decided to relinquish the Philadelphia Mills outlet mall, Pennsylvania's second-largest mall, to lenders, reflecting a continued effort to offload underperforming properties. This mall's value has plummeted from $370 million in 2007 to $101 million, burdened further by an unpaid $259 million loan. Simon's actions are driven by accelerated store closures, declining cash flow due to the surge in online shopping, and lease expirations of major tenants like Burlington, AMC Theatres, and Marshalls, contributing to financial instability. To manage its exposure, Simon has engaged in various sales and spinoffs of mall properties, even buying bankrupt retailers to avoid vacancies in their malls. Since 2012, the company's number of shopping centers has reduced from 317 to 195 as of Q1 2024. This ongoing shift in consumer behavior towards record e-commerce sales has put additional strain on traditional mall operators like Simon.

Despite this, shorter-term Treasury yields show no significant change, indicating no near-term rate cut expectations, particularly no cut foreseen in July but possible in September. In \"The market for the 2-year yield has been wrong all along,\" it is highlighted that the 2-year Treasury yield has continually misinterpreted the Federal Reserve's rate hike and cut decisions, initially predicting fewer and smaller rate hikes and later prematurely pricing in cuts. By April 2022, a 2.5% yield was promising amid historically low rates, yet this was much lower than the over 5% rates achieved by July 2023. Major financial analysts like Goldman Sachs also underestimated the terminal rate. The persistent misjudgment underscores that short-term T-bills would have been a better investment. As inflation remains unpredictable and persistent, future rate cuts may be further delayed, revealing the ongoing volatility and unforeseen outcomes in the market."

        "summary": "The article from Wolf Street, authored by Wolf Richter, provides an in-depth analysis of the Canadian housing market's status in June. Despite the Bank of Canada implementing a rate cut at the beginning of the month, the market saw minimal impact on overall prices, which remained flat with a slight increase of 0.1% month-to-month. However, prices are down 14% from their 2022 peak and 3.4% year-over-year. Sales rose by 3.7% from May but were down 9.4% year-over-year, with new listings growing for the fifth time in six months and inventory up 26% year-over-year. In \"The Most Splendid Housing Bubbles in Canada,\" Toronto saw a significant 15% decline from its peak, while Vancouver's drop was only 2.5%, staying flat over the past 10 months. Victoria and Ottawa experienced decreases of 11% and 10%, respectively, whereas Montreal had a minor 1.8% dip. Contrarily, Calgary and Quebec reached new high prices. Single-family home prices in Toronto increased by 0.3% month-to-month but remain 15% below their peak, with condos also slightly up by 0.2%. Hamilton-Burlington saw a slight decrease, 19.4% below peak. Vancouver's single-family homes rose by 0.2%, and condo prices stayed flat. Other highlights include Calgary's 0.5% increase to a new high, Montreal's 1.4% rise, Halifax-Dartmouth's 2.9% gain, Edmonton's 1.3% rise despite being 19% below peak, and Quebec City Area's 2.0% increase, reaching a new high. Winnipeg's single-family homes saw a 1.7% increase but remained 1.6% below their peak. The article underscores that certain markets have achieved record highs while others continue to decline."

        "summary": "In the article \"Services PPI Inflation Dishes Up Another Nasty Surprise, 6th Month in a Row. Bottom of U-Turn was in December\" by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street, the latest data from the Services Producer Price Index (PPI) reveals a persistent inflationary trend, marking the sixth consecutive month of increases. Services, which constitute 62% of the total PPI, have experienced significant cost spikes, reminiscent of early 2021, with the PPI for services showing a notable 7.0% annualized increase in June over May. This trend suggests that inflationary pressures are deeply entrenched in the services sector, with the bottom of this inflation cycle observed in December, indicating a clear upward trajectory since then. While core goods prices remain stable and less volatile, the rising service costs are likely to be passed on to consumers, potentially reigniting consumer price inflation. Overall, core PPI and total PPI have both shown recent notable increases, reflecting a broader trend of rising service costs and suggesting persistent underlying inflationary trends as the economy moves towards late 2024."

        "summary": "The article \"Beneath the Skin of CPI Inflation: Historic Plunge in Durable Goods Prices, Plunge in Gasoline, and Outliers in Services\" by Wolf Richter discusses the significant components impacting the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation, focusing on June's data. The overall CPI saw a 3.0% year-over-year increase with a slight month-to-month dip of 0.06%. A historic decline in durable goods prices, particularly new and used vehicles, contributed to this trend, as the durable goods CPI dropped by 4.1% year-over-year, marking the largest decrease since 2003. The Core CPI, excluding food and energy, grew by 3.3% year-over-year. The Core services CPI increased by 5.0% year-over-year, slightly above 5% since December, while the Rent of Primary Residence CPI and the Owners\u2019 Equivalent of Rent CPI saw their smallest increases since 2021. Core CPI experienced its smallest month-to-month rise since January 2021, and durable goods CPI faced a substantial annualized decline of 5.9% in June. Despite these trends, certain services have shown unexpected price increases, becoming outliers in the Core services CPI data. The monthly increase in Core services CPI was 1.6%, creating the second consecutive outlier. The Rent of Primary Residence CPI rose by 3.2% annualized, and the Owners\u2019 Equivalent of Rent CPI increased by 3.4% annualized in June. Motor vehicle maintenance and repair inflation rose substantially but is decelerating. The Food away from Home CPI saw significant increases, with the fastest monthly rise since January, and the \"food at home\" CPI rose only 0.1% month-to-month and 1.1% year-over-year, indicating cooling trends after pandemic-induced spikes. Gasoline prices fell sharply by 3.8% month-to-month and 2.5% year-over-year, influenced by seasonal variations, while electricity, natural gas services, heating oil, and related fuels saw moderate price changes. The article provides a comprehensive overview of the various factors affecting CPI inflation, highlighting the volatility and complexity of these economic indicators."

        "summary": "The article from Wolf Street, written by Wolf Richter, explores the current standstill in the housing market as home buyers remain on strike due to persistently high prices and mortgage rates hovering around 7%. In \"Home Buyers Remain on Strike, Housing Market Still Frozen as Prices Are Too High, Mortgage Rates Still 7%,\" Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell addressed Congress, highlighting that higher interest rates could ultimately make housing more affordable for younger individuals not yet in the market. Powell emphasized that while higher rates may be tough in the short term, they aim to achieve 2% inflation, creating a stronger economic foundation. The section \"Higher for Longer: 7% mortgages a year so far\" notes that the 30-year fixed mortgage rate has hovered between 6.75% and 7.9% since late 2022, contributing to limited consumer spending and reflecting the Fed's strategy to curb demand and inflation. Prospective buyers face tough refinancing decisions as renting remains comparatively cheaper. Historical context reveals that though 7% mortgage rates are not new, the current combination of high rates and inflated home prices evokes the strain of past housing bubbles. In \"With prices too high, buyers\u2019 strike continues,\" the article notes mortgage applications for home purchases are at historic lows, paralleling trends from late 2023 and significantly lower than 2021 and 2019 data. Inventory has grown with new listings, yet high prices deter buyers. Refinance applications remain reduced, primarily for cash-out purposes, showing a clear inverse relationship with mortgage rates."

June's listing prices remained flat from the previous year and were slightly below June 2022 levels, creating a triple top pattern. Moreover, \"Price Reductions\" highlight that 37.6% of active listings in June had reduced prices, a notable trend not seen in Realtor.com data dating back to 2016. The increased inventory and slight price reductions haven't significantly moved the available properties, indicating the housing market's ongoing challenges."

        "summary": "Used car and truck prices continue to spiral downward in a historic plunge, surrendering 60% of the stunning two-year spike, a development thoroughly examined in Wolf Richter's article for Wolf Street. In June, the prices of used cars, SUVs, pickup trucks, and vans sold at US auctions fell by 0.6% from May and 8.9% year-over-year, dropping to $17,934, the lowest since March 2021. Non-seasonally adjusted, wholesale prices decreased by 2.2% from May and 10.0% year-over-year, based on Manheim's Used Vehicle Value Index. Despite an overall drop, prices for used electric vehicles (EVs) remain up by 61% from January 2020, while used internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles are up by 31%. A ransomware attack on CDK's cloud-based dealer management system possibly disrupted dealership inventory replenishments from auctions. During the pandemic, demand for Teslas surged, contributing to a 145% spike in used EV prices, which later normalized when Tesla reduced prices. Overall, used car and truck auction prices surged 65% from January 2020 to their May 2022 peak, later conceding 52% of the increase. Prices for used full-size light-duty pickups spiked 68% from January 2020 to May 2021 but have since dropped, retaining a 36% increase, while compact pickup prices surged 88%, still standing 66% higher than January 2020. Used SUV prices rose 63% from January 2020 to November 2021 and then fell, keeping a 26% increase from January 2020 levels. Van prices spiked by 70% by May 2022 and declined, also maintaining a 26% increase from January 2020. Compact car prices increased 56% by May 2022 but fell back, now up only 17% from January 2020. Compact cars are approaching pre-pandemic affordability levels, with recent models primarily foreign brands due to US automakers' exit from the ICE compact car market, driving their renewed affordability."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article titled \"Who Made or Lost What between Brookfield, Starwood, MetLife? An Office CRE Deal of the Low-Interest-Rate Era Gets Shredded in Foreclosure,\" authored by Wolf Richter, examines the complex financial outcomes for stakeholders in Manhattan and El Segundo's commercial real estate market during the low-interest-rate era. Brookfield Asset Management experienced substantial losses in Manhattan after defaulting on mortgage payments for an office building, acquired from a joint venture between Starwood Capital Group and MetLife, leading to foreclosure primarily due to high vacancy rates and rising interest rates. The article highlights the perils associated with high leverage in such an environment, as noted in sections \"An Office CRE Deal of the Low-Interest-Rate Era Gets Shredded in Foreclosure\" and \"Massive losses spreading across equity, debt, landlords, and lenders globally\". Further, the foreclosure of a 257,000 square-foot office building in El Segundo by MetLife Investment Management, after Starwood Capital and Artisan Ventures defaulted on their loan, underscores the broader distress in commercial real estate. MetLife's acquisition of the building at $72.8 million, substantially below the $132 million purchase price paid by Starwood and Artisan Ventures in 2020, illustrates the severe decline in property value, now 45% less since February 2020, and reflects MetLife's more conservative approach despite sustaining an $11.1 million loss. However, MetLife now faces a high vacancy rate in El Segundo. In \"Who lost or made what\", Brookfield made a substantial gain of $65 million, nearly doubling a prior investment by selling an office building in El Segundo, contrasting sharply with the significant losses suffered by Starwood and Artisan Ventures, who lost their equity following foreclosure. This situation underscores the inflated valuations and investment risks prevalent during the era of ultra-low interest rates."

During an era of low interest rates, Brookfield purchased office properties at high prices, but as interest rates rose, property values plummeted, leading to defaults and foreclosures that inflicted substantial losses on involved parties, including Starwood and MetLife. In \"Widespread Losses Explained,\" the article focuses on how MetLife Investment Management foreclosed on a 12-story office building in El Segundo, originally bought by Starwood Capital and Artisan Ventures for $132 million in 2020 but valued at $72.8 million during foreclosure. Brookfield sold the property, initially bought for $67 million in 2017, for a $65 million profit in February 2020. Starwood Capital and Artisan Ventures lost $47 million as their equity was wiped out, while MetLife experienced an $11.1 million loss after acquiring the under-leased building. The overall scenario illustrates the risks of aggressive investment during low-interest periods. The article's section \"Who lost or made what\" highlights the extended fallout of these aggressive CRE investments."

The article explains that the QT process, aimed at managing inflationary pressures and reversing the pandemic-era Quantitative Easing (QE), includes a 41% reduction in Treasury securities and a 29% reduction in Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS). The \"Fed Balance Sheet QT\" section details these reductions, highlighting that the overall strategy began post-QE in April 2022, and June marks the first month of a slower QT pace. In the \"QT by category\" section, it mentions the Fed reduced Treasury holdings by $23 billion for a total of $1.33 trillion since June 2022, and MBS holdings by $19 billion, equal to a $404 billion total reduction from the peak. The \"Bank liquidity facilities\" section reports that the Discount Window's balance increased by $200 million to $6.4 billion, while the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) decreased by $1.6 billion to $106 billion after the Fed capped its expansion due to arbitrage opportunities.

Despite a 5% decrease in average sales prices to $426,000, Lennar's revenues increased by 9% due to a 15% rise in home deliveries. However, D.R. Horton faced a substantial cost increase when its hedging strategies failed, resulting in a $65 million charge to the cost of goods sold.

Stellantis fell to the sixth position for the first time, trailing Honda. General Motors (GM) and Ford observed YoY declines in internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle sales while experiencing significant spikes in EV sales. Vehicle prices dropped due to increased incentives and discounts. Additionally, a ransomware attack on CDK Global\u2019s cloud-based dealership management system affected nearly 15,000 dealers, leading to manual sales processing and delayed reporting, particularly impacting Q2 data. Despite this, new vehicle sales for Q2 rose by 9.1% from Q1, totaling 4.08 million vehicles, down just 0.4% YoY. Average incentives per vehicle grew by 51%, and the average transaction price fell by 3% YoY to $44,857 in June.

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter discusses the worsening state of commercial real estate (CRE) loans within the commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) market, highlighting surging delinquencies in the office, retail, and lodging sectors, suggesting that the market has yet to hit bottom. While industrial properties maintain strong financial health and multifamily properties manage to stay afloat amid broader economic difficulties, office CMBS delinquencies reached 7.6% in June, the highest since the 2016 oil bust, primarily driven by decreased office demand, floating-rate mortgages, and loan maturities with higher interest rates. The \"extend and pretend\" practice, where delinquent loans are renegotiated rather than foreclosed, has led landlords and lenders to prefer renegotiation to avoid taking inventory of depreciated properties, with significant losses for CMBS holders as major landlords, including Blackstone, abandon properties. The Retail CMBS delinquency rate for mall properties rose to 6.4% due to the ongoing \"Brick-and-Mortar Meltdown,\" with numerous retail chains filing for bankruptcy and major landlords walking away from malls. Despite challenges, the multifamily sector's CMBS delinquency rate rose modestly to 2.4% in June, remaining manageable as the sector is dominated by loans not securitized by private lenders, with the U.S. government responsible for a significant portion of these loans. Industrial CMBS delinquencies saw a slight increase to 0.6% in June but remain low, bolstered by infrastructure growth supporting ecommerce. Each section of the article\u2014\"It Gets Still Messier with CRE Loans, Bottom Not in Sight,\" \"So, yes, let\u2019s extend and pretend, please,\" \"Retail CMBS,\" and \"On the other hand...\"\u2014provides detailed insights into these conditions, underscoring the diverse impacts across different property types."

        "summary": "The article \"Inflation Saga Far from Over: Services CPI in the Euro Area Refuses to Slow for 8th Month in a Row\" on Wolf Street by Wolf Richter discusses the persistence of high inflation in the Euro Area, particularly focusing on the services sector, with services CPI remaining elevated for the eighth consecutive month. ECB President Christine Lagarde expresses concern over rising labor costs, which are contributing to persistent inflation in the services sector. In the \"By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET\" section, it is detailed that services inflation rose by 4.1% year-over-year in the 20 euro-using countries, the highest since October, suggesting that the 4%-plus range for services inflation is becoming established. Energy prices have significantly dropped from 2022 peaks but remain high, while durable goods prices fell and food prices increased at a lower rate. Core CPI, excluding volatile elements, increased by 2.9% in June, driven by stable services inflation, even as goods prices stabilized. Despite the ECB cutting its policy rate to 4.25% amid economic slowdown and inflation moderation, persistent services inflation and slow declines in goods prices could push core CPI above the ECB's 2% target. Christine Lagarde emphasized wage growth as a key factor behind services inflation, with substantial year-over-year increases in various Euro Area countries, and forward-looking wage growth measures indicating sustained high rates, suggesting services inflation may not ease soon."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article, \"Another of Our Imploded Stocks Ends in Bankruptcy: Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment, 2 Years after its Infamous Redbox Acquisition,\" covers the financial collapse of Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment (CSSE), which filed for bankruptcy following its ill-fated acquisition of Redbox's DVD kiosk business two years earlier. Initially seen as a strategic expansion of its streaming and video rental operations, the acquisition failed to produce the expected benefits, underscoring the risks involved in buying companies from private equity firms, a phenomenon described as \"Consensual Hallucination.\" Authored by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street, the report highlights CSSE\u2019s financial decline, exacerbated by its purchase of Redbox while saddled with debt. Despite being one of the first Regulation A+ IPOs under the 2012 JOBS Act and raising up to $50 million from small investors, the company consistently lost money annually, topping $636 million in 2023. Additional acquisitions, including streaming service Crackle and website A Plus, further strained finances. By June of that year, CSSE had depleted its cash reserves, missed payroll, and reported debts totaling $970 million against $414 million in assets. CEO William J. Rouhana, Jr. dismissed the board before stepping down, with Bart Schwartz taking over as CEO. The company is now seeking a debtor-in-possession loan to sustain operations during bankruptcy proceedings, or it may face liquidation. Once popular among speculative traders, CSSE's shares have now plunged to near worthlessness."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter examines the evolving status of the US dollar as a global reserve currency, highlighting that although it remains dominant, its share has been steadily declining. Central banks are diversifying their assets into other currencies and gold, with the USD's share increasing slightly to 58.9% in Q1 2023, up from a low of 58.4% in Q4 2022. Despite the decline, central banks held $6.77 trillion in USD-denominated assets out of $12.3 trillion in total foreign exchange reserves. The article outlines \"The other major reserve currencies,\" noting that the euro maintains a stable 19.7% share, while smaller increases are seen in \"nontraditional reserve currencies\" like the Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, and Swiss franc. However, the Chinese RMB has declined to its lowest level since Q2 2020. \"The rise of the 'nontraditional reserve currencies'\" is attributed to the search for higher yields and liquidity in various markets. Concurrently, central banks have increased their gold bullion holdings to 1.16 billion troy ounces valued at approximately $2.7 trillion, as noted in \"The rise of gold as central bank reserve asset.\" Finally, \"USD-exchange rates and foreign exchange reserves\" explain the impact of exchange rates on reporting reserves, noting that while holdings of USD assets remain unchanged, the value of non-USD assets fluctuates with currency exchange rates. Despite the historical fluctuations, the Dollar Index remains relatively stable, illustrating the ongoing, albeit declining, dominance of the US dollar."

        "summary": "A Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter explores the economic behaviors and patterns of American consumers through data on incomes, transfer receipts, spending, and saving. It reports that for the 17th consecutive month, incomes have outpaced inflation, giving households more capacity to spend and save. In the section \"Our Drunken Sailors Leaving the Party? Nah, Not Yet,\" it is highlighted that consumer spending in May increased significantly due to higher incomes, with disposable incomes, adjusted for inflation, rising by 0.5% from April. This continued trend indicates no immediate economic slowdown. The subsequent section discusses that income sources, excluding transfer receipts, grew by 0.5% month-over-month and 2% year-over-year, driven by employment growth and higher earnings from various sources. Transfer receipts also saw a modest increase, primarily due to rising Social Security benefits. The personal saving rate climbed to 3.9%, reflecting cautious but active financial behavior among consumers. In \"How our Drunken Sailors disposed of their disposable income,\" the article notes that consumer spending, adjusted for inflation, increased by 0.3% in May and 2.4% from the previous year, reflecting steady growth. Spending on services, despite inflation, grew, covering essentials such as rents and healthcare. Nondurable goods spending rose by 0.3% for the month and 1.6% year-over-year, while durable goods spending increased by 1.1% for the month, indicating sustained purchases of durable items. This comprehensive analysis suggests that income growth and consumer spending remain robust, with no immediate signs of economic decline."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter, \"Fed\u2019s Wait-and-See on Rate Cuts Makes Sense amid Whiplash Data,\" examines the Federal Reserve's cautious approach to interest rate cuts amid conflicting economic signals. The article notes that while the core PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) inflation rate over the past six months is the highest since mid-2023, pointing to ongoing inflationary pressures, there are unusual fluctuations such as a significant drop in durable goods orders. The May data reveal the \"core\" PCE price index rose just 1.0% annualized month-over-month, primarily due to a sharp decline in the durable goods index (-9.1% annualized) and a modest increase in the core services index (+2.1% annualized). The six-month annualized core PCE price index rose by 3.2%, the worst increase since July last year. In \"In summary, year-over-year,\" it\u2019s highlighted that the overall PCE price index remained unchanged from April to May but rose by 2.6% year-over-year, while the core PCE price index also increased by 2.6% year-over-year, staying above the Fed's 2% target. The durable goods PCE price index saw a 3.2% year-over-year drop, the largest since 2004. The core services PCE price index increased by 2.1% annualized from April to May, marking the smallest increase since August 2023. However, significant consumer expenses in the core services sector such as housing, healthcare, and transportation services continue to experience entrenched inflation, with the housing PCE price index accelerating to 5.2% annualized in May. Other core services categories exhibited volatility; for example, financial services and insurance showed a 5.4% year-over-year increase but a -3.9% month-over-month decline, and the healthcare PCE price index rose 3.1% year-over-year with an 8.8% month-to-month annualized increase. This complex economic environment underlines the Fed's cautious stance on rate cuts."

Despite an overall 1.4% fall in corporate pre-tax profits for non-financial domestic industries, which stood at $2.66 trillion, the year-over-year figures were up nearly 10%, indicating significant growth previously. The financial sector saw an 11.7% rise in profits, reaching $758 billion, a reversal from earlier declines. The BEA figures these profits from IRS data and SEC statements, excluding capital gains and dividends to capture profits strictly from production. Profits in \"other nonfinancial\" industries surged by 4.2% in Q1 and 16.5% year-over-year, sparking discussions about \"greedflation.\" Nondurable-goods manufacturing saw a steep 15.3% decline in Q1, and durable-goods manufacturing profits dropped 7.4% but were still up annually. Retail trade profits dipped slightly but saw a substantial year-over-year increase, more than doubling since early 2020. Wholesale trade profits fell 7.6% in Q1 with no significant year-over-year change. The information sector enjoyed an 8.8% quarterly increase and a 26.6% annual rise due to layoffs, while transportation and warehousing profits rebounded significantly with an 8.8% Q1 rise and a 21.2% year-over-year increase.

        "summary": "The article from Wolf Street, written by Wolf Richter, examines the current housing market dynamics characterized by a significant decline in home demand and a rise in inventory levels. The National Association of Realtors (NAR), referencing their pending home sales data, indicates that the index value dropped by 2.1% from April and 6.8% year-over-year in May, bringing it close to the record low set in April 2020. This index, standing at 70.8 compared to an average of 100 in 2001, represents a 29% decrease, with sharp declines when compared to recent years. Despite increasing inventory levels that hit 3.7 months in May (the highest since June 2020) and a significant 18.5% year-over-year jump to 1.28 million homes, demand has noticeably plummeted. The NAR describes the situation as an \"interesting point\" where rising availability contrasts with dropping buyer interest, leading to expectations of \"stabilizing home prices\" in the latter half of 2024. Although NAR anticipates a decrease in mortgage rates could boost home buying activity, they project that mortgage rates will remain above 6% through 2024 and 2025, even with potential Federal Reserve rate cuts."

        "summary": "The article from Wolf Street, written by Wolf Richter, discusses the dramatic devaluation of the Japanese yen, which has fallen to 161 against the US dollar, a decline of 34% since 2020 and 53% since 2012, raising concerns of a potential currency collapse. The section \"Yen Drops to 161 against USD\" explains how Japan's prolonged trade deficits and weak yen exacerbate energy price shocks, prompting the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to reconsider its aggressive monetary policies. In \"Jawboning and costly interventions were useless,\" the article details how Japanese authorities spent $62 billion in foreign exchange interventions to support the yen, which had only temporary effects as the yen dropped past the \u00a5160 level. Despite \"serious concerns\" expressed by currency chief Masato Kanda and statements from Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki, no direct actions were implemented. The section \"A collapsed yen is not good for Japan\" highlights the detrimental impact of a weak yen, such as high import costs and strained economic conditions, despite benefiting Japanese global companies on paper. Inflation and rising service costs are also affecting domestic profit margins, although increased tourism is a positive outcome. Lastly, \"The BOJ\u2019s painfully too-little-too-late\" discusses how the BOJ was slow to respond as other central banks raised rates and tapered QE while maintaining negative rates and yield-curve control, only starting to reverse its policy by 2024. The BOJ's minor rate hikes and ending some QE measures were insufficient, planning more significant steps like further rate hikes and QT in contrast to countries like Mexico and Brazil, which safeguarded their currencies with early and substantial rate hikes."

Meanwhile, Boston, New York, Miami, Los Angeles, San Diego, Washington DC, and Chicago have achieved new highs. The previously intense rate-cut enthusiasm has waned, leading to a noticeable deceleration in housing price growth. The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index, covering prices from February through April, highlights the residual effects of the Rate-Cut Mania that started in November and peaked in February. By April, the 20-City Index showed a 1.4% month-to-month rise in home prices, slightly down from the previous month's 1.6%. Year-over-year, the index increased by 7.2%, down from 7.5% in March and 7.4% in February. All 20 metro areas saw price increases, with monthly rises from 0.1% for New York condos to 2.2% for Boston single-family homes. Compared to the June 2022 high, the index was up 3.5%, though prices in seven metro areas remained below their 2022 peaks. The section \"The Most Splendid Housing Bubbles by Metro\" delves into home-price changes across key metro areas like San Francisco, Seattle, and Phoenix. Notably, since 2000, San Diego led home-price inflation at 343%, followed by Miami and Los Angeles, against an 86% rise in the consumer price index for the same period. The Case-Shiller Index measures home-price inflation using the \"sales pairs\" method, comparing current and previous sale prices adjusted for improvements. Despite recent spikes post-2020 Fed policies, six metros, including Chicago, didn't qualify for the most splendid housing bubbles list due to relatively lower overall home-price inflation. Chicago\u2019s home prices rose 105% since 2000."

In June, the BoC had reduced policy rates by 25 basis points due to cooled inflation trends but had warned that future cuts depended on inflation continuing to ease towards a 2% target. In May, the Core CPI excluding food and energy spiked by 4.9% month-to-month annualized, maintaining a year-over-year increase of 2.9% for the fourth consecutive month. The BoC\u2019s preferred measures of underlying inflation, referred to as CPI trim and CPI median, showed sharp re-acceleration with both measures increasing by 4.1% on an annualized basis and nearing 3% year-over-year. National Bank of Canada analysts were surprised, noting that inflation had not been fully tamed, echoing warnings from central banks about persistent inflation pressures. Overall CPI rose to 3.8% annualized, holding at 2.9% year-over-year for the fifth month. In the housing sector, the CPI for shelter, which includes rents and homeownership costs, surged 4.7% annualized and 6.4% year-over-year, staying high for the fourth month.

The Ford F-150, traditionally a top seller, dropped to fourth place with a decreasing market share despite an increase in EV truck sales. The Toyota RAV4 surged to the #1 bestseller position due to replenished inventories, while the Tesla Model Y remained second with a slight increase in market share. The Honda CR-V climbed to third place, and the Chevy Silverado fell to sixth. These changes highlight significant dynamics in the automotive marketplace, with Ford's reliance on F-150 trucks facing challenges as sales of its internal combustion engine models declined even though overall new vehicle sales increased. In the \"Share by automaker\" section, the rankings of new vehicle registrations remained mostly consistent, with General Motors leading at 15.7%, followed closely by Toyota at 15.6%, and Ford at 13.0%. Subaru moved up to ninth place while Tesla dropped to tenth. Stellantis was in fourth at 9.0%, Honda in fifth at 8.8%, and Nissan in sixth at 7.3%.

        "summary": "In a recent Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter titled \"Home Sales Sag Further, Hit by Mortgage Rates. Price Cuts & Active Listings Surge. Median Price Skewed by Surge in High-End Sales,\" home sales have continued to decline, significantly impacted by high mortgage rates around 7%. Particularly, the mid- and lower-priced segments are experiencing a sharp drop as potential buyers hold off, anticipating lower rates in the future. Concurrently, price reductions and the number of active listings are increasing. Despite overall declines, there has been a surge in high-end sales, which has skewed the median price upward. The sales rate of existing homes in May dropped to 4.11 million, slightly above the lowest levels since the 2010 housing bust. The decrease in market activity and inventory levels is due to homeowners with 3% mortgage rates choosing to stay put. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has fluctuated between 6.5% and 7.5% since late 2022. Price reductions have affected 35% of active listings, with supply levels growing to 3.7 months and active listings reaching 788,000 homes. The average days on the market was 44, the highest for any May since 2020. Sales data from the National Association of Realtors (NAR) show marked increases in higher-end home sales, which have skewed the median home price upward to reach record highs of $424,500 for single-family homes and $371,300 for condos and co-ops."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article, written by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET, delves into the significant downturn in global steel production, focusing particularly on China. China's steel production suffered its worst three-year drop ever, decreasing by 4.3% to 1,019 million tonnes in 2023 due to a property crisis and manufacturing slowdown. This marks a stark contrast to years of booming growth. Despite this decline, global crude steel production slightly rose to 1,892 million tonnes in 2023. The \"China v. the Rest of the World\" section reveals China's declining yet still dominant share of global steel production at 53.9%, while North America's share dipped to 5.8%. The top steel-producing countries include China, producing 1,019 million tonnes, followed by India at 141 million tonnes, with the US trailing well behind. Global steel company rankings see Nucor advancing to the 15th position globally, while US Steel, ranked 24th, faces acquisition by Nippon Steel, the fourth largest. China holds eleven of the top twenty company slots. Overall, the article illustrates a shifting landscape in global steel production, significantly impacted by China's economic challenges."

        "file_location": "./data/The Foreign Holders of the Ballooning US Debt: They\u2019re Buying, But Don\u2019t Keep Up.md",
        "summary": "Foreign holders of U.S. debt, particularly from the Euro Area, Canada, and other financial centers, have been increasing their holdings significantly. This comes as China reduces its U.S. Treasury securities, leading to a shift in the distribution of U.S. debt holdings. Despite this increased appetite from other regions, the overall foreign purchases are not keeping pace with the rapidly growing U.S. debt. By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET, the article explores foreign investors' continued support for US Treasury debt, now nearing $35 trillion, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding demand. Despite the ballooning debt, appetite for Treasury securities remains high, as indicated by the 10-year yield standing at 4.2%, which is below the expected rate of over 5%, considering the current inflation rate at 3.4% and short-term yields at 5.5%. The share of foreign holdings has seen foreign investors steadily increasing their Treasury securities holdings, but the rapid growth of U.S. debt has reduced their share of total debt from over 33% in 2014-2016 to 22.9% now. Consequently, U.S. debt financing has become less reliant on foreign holders, including China and Japan. In March, foreign-held Treasury debt peaked at an all-time high and slightly dipped in April to $7.92 trillion, representing a 6.3% year-over-year increase. China and Hong Kong v. the Euro Area explains how China and Hong Kong have reduced their combined holdings of US Treasury securities from over $1.4 trillion in 2012-2017 to $992 billion currently, while the Euro Area's holdings surged from $500 billion in 2011 to $1.58 trillion now, marking an over $1 trillion increase and a year-over-year rise of 14.6%. Six major financial centers\u2014the UK, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Cayman Islands, and Ireland\u2014have collectively increased their holdings to $2.31 trillion, up 9.2% year-over-year, with details including the UK at $710 billion, Luxembourg at $384 billion, and the Cayman Islands at $319 billion. Japan's Treasury securities holdings have increased by 2.2% year-over-year, reaching $1.15 trillion. Other top foreign holders of Treasury securities include Canada, which holds $338 billion in US Treasury securities, marking a 36.9% increase year-over-year; Taiwan at $257 billion, a 5.3% increase year-over-year; India with $234 billion, showing a yearly decline of 2.2%; Brazil with $224 billion and a 2.7% decrease year-over-year; and France, part of the Euro Area, surging to a record high of $277 billion, outpacing Germany, which holds $87 billion."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article, \"The Collapse of the EV SPACs: Fisker Joins the Bankruptcy Party, Others on the Verge\" by Wolf Richter, discusses the financial downfall of electric vehicle (EV) companies that went public via special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) during a period of easy monetary policy. Fisker, which went public through a SPAC in October 2020, filed for bankruptcy after burning through over $1 billion in investor funds. This trend reflects a broader pattern of EV SPAC bankruptcies, marked by the sector's inability to transform initial enthusiasm and high valuations into sustainable businesses. Fisker, led by CEO Henrik Fisker, failed to reach mass production and faced quality issues with its Ocean SUV, culminating in production halts, inventory problems, delisting from the NYSE, and eventual bankruptcy. Other companies that followed this path include Electric Last Mile Solutions, which went bankrupt within a year of its SPAC merger, Proterra, which declared bankruptcy in April 2023, and Lordstown Motors, which filed for bankruptcy after misleading investors about additional funding. The section \"EV SPACS that are no longer twitching\" illustrates these cases. Meanwhile, the section \"EV SPACs that are still twitching\" highlights companies on the brink of collapse, such as VinFast Auto, Nikola, Canoo, Lucid Motors, Faraday Future, Lion Electric, Polestar, and Rivian; all of which have seen significant declines in their stock prices and face substantial financial challenges despite initial market optimism."

        "summary": "In a Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter, it is highlighted that consumer spending has surged in the retail and vehicle sectors, but prices have fallen from pandemic highs, normalizing the overall cost of goods. This trend suggests continued substantial purchasing by consumers, positively impacting inflation-adjusted consumer spending and GDP. Retail sales are influenced by seasonal adjustments and inflation/deflation, with May seeing significant unit sales growth in vehicles and other items, though dollar sales increases were more modest due to lower prices. Durable goods like vehicles, electronics, and furniture experienced price drops, benefiting consumers but presenting challenges for retailers. Similarly, nondurable goods such as gasoline and apparel saw price decreases, which lowered dollar sales for retailers. Examining retail sales by major segment, new and used vehicle sales showed significant unit increases despite price drops, ecommerce maintained consistent growth, and bars and restaurants had mixed results with seasonal highs. Gas stations' sales mirrored gasoline prices, building materials dropped from pandemic peaks, and segments like clothing and general merchandise showed moderate growth, while furniture and home furnishings declined due to a shift towards ecommerce. Department stores continued to shrink, and sporting goods and electronics had mixed results, reflecting broader retail trends. Overall, lower prices in consumer goods play a significant role in economic metrics and retail sales dynamics."

        "summary": "In the Wolf Street article \"Hot Wage Growth Bedevils Wishlist for ECB Rate Cuts,\" Wolf Richter discusses the recent surge in wages across the Euro Area, which has risen by 5.3%, matching a previous record increase. This significant wage growth complicates the European Central Bank's (ECB) strategy for potential rate cuts, as the ECB identifies it as a substantial risk to inflation targets. IG Metall, Germany's largest labor union, is advocating for a 7% wage hike over 12 months to offset inflation, reflecting similar trends throughout the Euro Area. For instance, notable year-over-year wage increases in Q1 include 6.3% in Germany, 7.6% in the Netherlands, and 9.8% in Austria. This data emerged shortly after the ECB's rate cut, underscoring wage increases as a critical component in inflation expectations. Additionally, the ECB's measure of \"negotiated wages,\" linked to collective bargaining agreements, recorded a 4.7% year-over-year rise in Q1, covering approximately two-thirds of the Euro Area economy. While rising wages support households by enhancing spending and economic growth, they also perpetuate inflation by elevating demand and labor costs. Despite the ECB's efforts to control inflation, the Euro Area's core CPI has recently risen to 2.9%, exceeding the 2% target and signaling persistent inflationary pressures."

The \"Spring selling season is a dud\" section highlights a 0.6% decrease in home sales from April to May, marking the fourth consecutive month of decline and a 5.9% year-over-year drop, while new listings rose slightly by 0.5%, pushing inventory levels up 28.4% year-over-year. Despite the Bank of Canada cutting its policy rate by 25 basis points to 4.75% in June, quantitative tightening continues to moderate the market. The \"Home Prices in the most splendid Housing-Bubble Markets\" section details regional variations, with Greater Toronto single-family home prices decreasing 15.8% from their peak and condo prices down 12.8%, while Calgary and Quebec City reached new price highs. Vancouver's single-family home prices rose 5.6% year-over-year, but condo prices fell 0.4% month-to-month. Edmonton's single-family home prices increased 7.7% year-over-year, with condos rising 11.1%.

The broader market, as represented by the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index, has struggled in comparison to these large-cap giants. While the Russell 2000 has fallen to levels last seen in January 2021 and is down 1% year-to-date in 2024, the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index has dropped to January 2022 levels. The Russell 2000 declined 1.6% on Friday and is down 18% from its peak in November 2021. In stark contrast, the Nasdaq Composite achieved its fifth consecutive record close, up 9.1% from its previous high and 73% from a trough in December 2022, driven significantly by a handful of large-cap stocks. The S&P 500 is heavily influenced by six massive stocks, which contribute $15.2 trillion of its $45 trillion market cap, raising concerns about the lack of diversification. Year-to-date in 2024, larger indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are up significantly, revealing a fragmented market. Notably, Tesla has fallen from the group of top seven technology stocks with a notable market cap drop, but the remaining six continue to drive substantial market movements. This disparity highlights the concentration of gains within a handful of mega-cap stocks, creating a fragile market dynamic."

        "summary": "The article \"Rate-Cut Mania\u2019s 20.7% Spike in French Stock Market Comes Home to Roost\" by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET examines the significant volatility experienced by the French stock market, particularly the CAC 40 index. This volatility stemmed from a 20.7% spike driven by speculation around rate cuts and monetary easing. However, this gain reversed sharply due to unfulfilled expectations, underscoring the risks tied to speculative investments and the necessity of sound economic fundamentals. Despite a recent 8.9% drop from its all-time high on May 15, influenced by political uncertainty and fears of a far-right election win, these declines were relatively modest when compared to the preceding surge. The article points out that the correction only reverted the CAC 40 back to its April 2023 levels, preserving most of the year's gains. It also highlights how media alarmism exaggerated the market downturn, contrasting with the actual long-term impact, suggesting that the media's portrayal amplified perceptions rather than reflecting substantial market dynamics."

        "summary": "Total liabilities on the Federal Reserve's balance sheet have dropped by $1.71 trillion as a result of Quantitative Tightening (QT), reaching $7.22 trillion, the lowest since December 2020. The reduction in liabilities corresponds to the decline in assets following the end of Quantitative Easing (QE) in April 2022. The five key liabilities include reserves, Other Federal Reserve Assets (ON RRPs), currency in circulation, the Treasury General Account (TGA), and reverse repurchase agreements (RRPs) with foreign official counterparties. Reserves have decreased by $265 billion during QT, currently at $3.46 trillion. ON RRPs saw a significant $1.92 trillion decrease from their peak, now at $448 billion. Meanwhile, Currency in Circulation stands at $2.35 trillion, the TGA at $650 billion, and RRPs with foreign officials at $385 billion, with specific functions independent of QE or QT decisions.

        "summary": "In an article by Wolf Street, Wolf Richter reports on Fitch Ratings' outlook on the office commercial real estate (CRE) market, which contrasts with some fund managers' optimism. Fitch anticipates further deterioration in office loan performance through 2024 due to higher interest rates, slower economic growth, a tighter lending environment, and a decline in office demand. With significant vacancy levels in major office markets, around 30%, refinancing challenges are mounting, possibly leading to increased loan delinquencies. Fitch raised its forecast for office delinquencies to surpass levels seen during the Financial Crisis by the end of 2024. Additionally, the $1.2 billion in CMBS office loans that became delinquent in May, offset by $2 billion resolving delinquent office loans, caused fluctuations in the Office CMBS delinquency rate, which dropped to 6.94%.

        "summary": "The Federal Reserve's balance sheet decreased by $107 billion in May, reaching $7.26 trillion, the lowest since December 2020. Overall, $1.71 trillion has been shed since the end of quantitative easing in April 2022, removing 40% of Treasury securities and 28% of Mortgage-Backed Securities added during the pandemic. The Fed aims to gradually reduce its balance sheet without causing disruptions, moving away from the pace set in May to a new schedule starting in June. Wolf explains that the Fed's balance sheet increase before 2008 was tied to the rising currency in circulation, which has quadrupled from $600 billion in 2003 to $2.35 trillion today. The increase in total assets from $720 billion in 2003 to $910 billion in August 2008 closely followed this. The red line on the graph reflects the Fed's varied assets, including overnight repos and a growing base of Treasury securities.  \nAmid the Financial Crisis, the Fed's balance sheet further expanded due to the government transferring its checking accounts to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for security. This move added $703 billion to the balance sheet in 2009, marking it as a liability. The inclusion of this, along with the currency in circulation and other liabilities like reserves and ON RRPs, totals over $3 trillion. The Fed reduced its Treasury securities holdings by $57 billion in May, reaching $4.46 trillion, the lowest since September 2020. Since the pandemic, the Fed has shed 40% of the $3.27 trillion in Treasury securities added through QE. The monthly roll-off cap will decrease to $25 billion starting in June, excluding inflation protection from TIPS. In May, the Fed lowered its MBS holdings by $17 billion, totaling $2.35 trillion, the lowest since July 2021. The reduction in MBS holdings has reached 28% of the amount added during pandemic QE. Due to decreased mortgage payments from slowed sales and refinancing, MBS removal from the balance sheet is below the $35-billion cap, which has now been effectively removed under the new QT policy. Bank liquidity facilities discussed in the article include the Discount Window, with outstanding loans dropping from $153 billion to $6.2 billion in May, and the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), which decreased from $168 billion to $108 billion and is on track to reach zero by March 11, 2025. The Discount Window offers loans at 5.5% interest but with a stigma attached, leading banks to use it sparingly. The BTFP faced challenges due to an arbitrage opportunity that spiked its balances, prompting the Fed to adjust rates and eventually end the program, aligning with the broader reduction of bank-panic facilities to zero. In May, assets dropped by $108 billion despite the $95 billion cap on Quantitative Tightening (QT). Treasury securities took a big hit with a $57 billion decline, while MBS dropped by $17 billion. Additionally, BTFP assets fell by $16 billion, Unamortized Premiums and Discounts by $4 billion, and other assets by $10 billion. The Discount Window along with remnants of 2020-era SPVs accounted for a $1 billion decrease."

Homeowners with 6% or 7% mortgages meant for refinancing may feel stuck, waiting for rate cuts that may not come soon due to the Fed's inflation concerns. The frozen housing market is characterized by high prices, leading buyers to remain on strike, as reflected in record-low mortgage applications for home purchases and a decline in closed and pending sales. Refinancing applications without cash-out have significantly decreased, with remaining refis mostly being cash-out refis as rates have risen, further contributing to the stagnation in the housing market."

        "summary": "In his article on Wolf Street, Wolf Richter criticizes the Bank of Japan (BoJ) for ending quantitative easing (QE) too late, given Japan's trade deficits and a weakened yen. The BoJ's JGB holdings showed fluctuations, with equity ETF and Japanese REIT purchases halted, corporate bonds decreasing, and loans peaking in March before dropping in May. Despite a steady asset level, the BoJ has faced pressure as the yen depreciated against the dollar due to Federal Reserve policy changes. Rising inflation for Japanese businesses, particularly in services, gives the BoJ impetus for potential rate hikes. Wolf highlights the negative impact of a weak yen on Japan due to trade deficits since 2010, leading to increased import costs, higher energy prices, and challenges for major manufacturers' offshoring strategies. Criticizing the BoJ's slow response, Wolf argues for substantial quantitative tightening and rate hikes to stabilize the yen, citing the bank's miscalculations and emphasizing the need for decisive action rather than incremental changes."

This boom is seen across industries like semiconductors, with massive investments following the CHIPS Act, and beyond, including the auto industry and other sectors. While inflation plays a role in construction costs, it is just a small factor fueling this trend, reflecting a larger corporate strategy shift amid supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions. Construction costs are only a part of the total investment in a factory, with semiconductor plants requiring substantial funds for equipment and operation. Companies like Intel and TSMC are making multi-billion-dollar investments in fab facilities, contributing to the overall construction surge.

        "summary": "Wolf Street's article, written by Wolf Richter, delves into the escalating issue of interest payments on the US government's ballooning debt, which have surged in Q1 2024 to $264 billion, reflecting a 21% increase. Despite solid tax receipts of $775 billion, interest payments now exceed corporate tax revenue and surpass half of individual income taxes collected. The ratio of interest payments to tax receipts stood at 34.1% in Q1, down from a peak of 36.1% in Q3, signaling potential strain on national income. Interest payments, amounting to 3.8% of GDP, have reached levels not seen since 1998, posing concerns about the substantial portion of the economic output allocated to covering these expenses. Wolf suggests that higher yields may attract investors to purchase government debt, alleviating demand challenges but potentially leading to increased interest payments and inflation. This inflationary trend could serve as both a consequence and a long-term solution, benefiting governments by boosting tax revenue and devaluing existing debts."

        "summary": "Wolf Richter discusses Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey's outline of the BOE's plan to revert to pre-Financial Crisis liquidity handling methods using repos instead of QE. The BOE aims to drain reserves and utilize repos for liquidity management, a shift from long-term bonds to short-term repos. This move echoes traditional central bank practices and signals a departure from the QE era. The Fed, having revived its Standing Repo Facility in 2021, is also preparing to use repos more prominently, learning from past liquidity issues during quantitative tightening. Wolf explains that during quantitative easing, the BOE lent funds to the Asset Purchase Facility, its off-balance-sheet entity, which then bought bonds. As quantitative tightening reduces assets in the AFP, loans are repaid to the BOE, decreasing the balance sheet. The BOE purchased bonds in waves during crises like the financial crisis, Euro Debt Crisis, Brexit, and the pandemic, with holdings nearly doubling to \u00a3895 billion during the pandemic. The BOE is unique in actively selling bonds under QT, with the APF declining by \u00a3194 billion, or 22%, from its peak, including shedding all its corporate bonds and 44% of pandemic bond purchases. Wolf explains that the Bank of England sold bonds outright to reduce its holdings. By February 2022, the BOE held about 55 gilt issues with varying maturities, stretching out to 2071. To expedite this, the bank began selling portions of each issue regularly. For example, one issue set to mature in 2039 has already been completely sold. Others, like the 2071 and 2068 maturities, have been significantly reduced from their peak levels. The article discusses the drawdown of reserves by quantitative tightening (QT) and the importance of maintaining a balance to prevent a liquidity shortage in the financial system. Governor Bailey highlights the historical use of lower reserves pre-crisis but stresses the necessity of adequate reserves for financial stability. The concept of a \"Preferred Minimum Range of Reserves\" (PMRR) is introduced, aiming to estimate the minimum level of reserves needed for banks' transactions and liquidity management. Currently, reserves stand at \u00a3760 billion, with the PMRR estimated between \u00a3345 billion to \u00a3490 billion, suggesting a potential further drop in the balance sheet by \u00a3270 billion to \u00a3415 billion. The timeline for reaching this range could be by the second half of 2025 due to the ongoing QT and unwinding of the TFSME. Wolf explains that as the level of reserves demanded by banks approaches minimum levels, temporary frictions may occur in money markets. To address these challenges, the Bank of England introduced a Short-Term Repo facility in 2022, alongside other reserve supply operations like the Indexed Long-Term Repo. The Short-Term Repo allows banks to borrow unlimited reserves against gilt collateral at Bank Rate. This combination of facilities aims to manage the unwind of QE and the TFSME smoothly without sacrificing monetary control on the path to the Potential Minimum Reserve Requirement Ratio (PMRR). The Bank of England official discussed how the process of quantitative tightening (QT) will evolve once the balance sheet stabilizes. \"QT enters a new phase\" as the gilts in the APF could drop below the Prudential Minimum Requirement Ratio (PMRR), prompting the use of other facilities like the Sterling Monetary Framework (STR) to make up for the reserve shortfall. He differentiates between quantitative easing (QE) and QT, emphasizing that repos are not QE but rather short-term secured loans that may become more prominent in the future, potentially shifting the asset mix from bonds to repos. The official suggests a return to historic practices of lending on a secured basis, marking a shift in monetary policy strategy. The Bank of England has lost billions due to interest rate risk with falling gilt prices and rising yields. Quantitative Easing (QE) transferred this risk from the private sector to the central bank, a process that Quantitative Tightening (QT) is now reversing. The BOE aims to transition from gilts to repos to eliminate interest rate risk, despite a slow process of unwinding significant gilt holdings. The shift to repos will likely result in increased repo operations in the future."

        "summary": "The Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter delves into the current state of the new-vehicle market, where inventory gluts are becoming increasingly problematic for many brands. Automakers are responding by rolling out incentives to boost sales, although the necessary price reductions have yet to materialize. Despite a surge in incentive spending, retail sales remain below pre-pandemic levels, signaling challenging times for the industry. Inventory levels have ballooned, with a substantial 51% increase in new vehicle inventories compared to a year ago. Automakers are offering incentives and reducing interest rates, but are cautious about significant price cuts due to concerns about profit margins."

Richter highlights the sensitivity of the housing sector to interest rates and its role in monetary policy transmission. Despite efforts to combat inflation through interest rate hikes and Quantitative Tightening, rent inflation remains high due to lag effects. The slow impact of 7% mortgages on consumer spending is expected to gradually reduce overall demand. Home prices significantly influence households' financial stability, prompting policymakers to closely monitor the housing sector."

The article explores the rise of subprime delinquencies due to risky lending practices, affecting used vehicles more than new ones. Used vehicle market dynamics, including price fluctuations and collapses of subprime dealer/lenders, have disrupted the industry. While losses for investors in subprime auto loans have been moderate, the overall auto loan delinquency rate rose to 7.9% in Q1, driven by subprime issues. The burden of auto debt remains high, especially for subprime borrowers facing inflated car prices.

Over the last four years, ecommerce sales have grown by 90%, far outpacing non-ecommerce retail trade sales which only increased by 26%. The share of ecommerce sales rose to 15.9%, the highest level since Q2 2020, indicating a continuous takeover of the retail market by ecommerce. While non-ecommerce retail trade has almost stagnated, with only a 0.3% rise in Q1, certain sectors like gas stations, food stores, and car dealerships have been shielded to some extent. However, shifts are on the horizon, with the online growth of groceries and used vehicle sales starting to make an impact. The article then delves into what Walmart revealed about ecommerce, noting a 22% surge in US online sales, significantly boosting overall comparable sales which rose by 3.8%. Without the growth in ecommerce, the overall figure would have only been 1.0%. Walmart's success in groceries has been paramount, with the company now the largest grocery store in the US. The CEO emphasized the convenience aspect of ecommerce, particularly in relation to fulfillment centers, faster delivery, and an expanded product range catering to a broader audience. Walmart's focus on attracting higher income customers to its ecommerce platform through convenience, especially in categories like apparel and fashion, indicates a shift in consumer behavior towards online shopping."

Mortgage balances hit a record high in Q1, with HELOC balances also seeing a significant rise. The burden of mortgage debt, measured against disposable income, has remained relatively steady, despite recent increases in income. Delinquency rates for mortgages and HELOCs have not yet normalized post-pandemic, and foreclosures are gradually increasing from pandemic lows. Foreclosures may not be a critical issue as long as home prices remain stable and homeowners stay employed, although a sudden mass selling of homes could create problems. Banks are not as exposed to mortgage risks this time around, with most mortgages now held by government entities, reducing the potential for a financial system collapse stemming from failing mortgages."

These exchanges offer an alternative to traditional bankruptcy court restructurings, allowing companies to negotiate with creditors and potentially swap out debt for equity. This trend reflects the challenges faced by highly leveraged companies in the current economic environment. Distressed debt exchanges significantly increase default numbers when included in default rates, with investors motivated by loose financial conditions to engage in these deals. Leveraged loans, popular among junk-rated companies, have led to a surge in exchanges since the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates. Despite rising defaults due to borrowers struggling with higher interest payments, leveraged-loan issuance has increased, while distressed debt exchanges remain prevalent in the junk bond realm."

        "summary": "In a Wolf Street article by Wolf Richter, the Federal Reserve's balance sheet has decreased by $1.6 trillion from its peak, now at $7.36 trillion, the lowest level seen since December 2020. Quantitative Tightening (QT) has removed 38% of Treasury securities and 27% of Mortgage-Backed Securities added during the pandemic QE. QT details include slowing down and starting in June, with a Treasury cap adjustment to $25 billion and MBS runoff to continue at $35 billion, aiming for MBS to eventually disappear from the balance sheet. Treasury securities have decreased by $1.25 trillion, while MBS holdings dropped by $368 billion due to slower home sales and refinancing. The Discount Window provides liquidity to banks at 5.5% interest, with $6.8 billion in loans in April. The Bank Term Funding Program decreased to $124 billion and will phase out by March 2025. In the next 12 months, the balance sheet may shrink to $7.28 trillion, with assets potentially decreasing by $630 billion by May 2025, without MBS roll-off acceleration, reaching $6.63 trillion."

        "summary": "In the article, Wolf Richter discusses the current state of delinquencies in office CMBS loans. Delinquencies on floating-rate office CMBS loans have reached 20%, while fixed-rate loans stand at a much lower 4.7%. The rise in delinquencies for floating-rate loans is attributed to landlords struggling with rising vacancies and interest rates. The shift from fixed-rate to floating-rate office loans as interest rates increased has further complicated the situation. The overall delinquency rates for CMBS loans show the office sector as the worst-performing category, with multifamily and industrial sectors faring better. Despite some challenges, concerns persist over repayment defaults for fixed-rate loans and oversupply in the office market. The data indicates a growing share of floating-rate office loans in the market, highlighting the risks associated with adjustable-rate loans compared to the stability of fixed-rate loans."

Powell's emphasis on the possibility of rate hikes marks a significant departure from past discussions centered on rate cuts. The Federal Reserve would consider hiking rates if evidence suggests the current policy stance is not tight enough to bring inflation down to 2%. Powell expressed caution towards rate hikes, stating that it was unlikely the next move would be a hike. The Fed remains patient and cautious in considering rate cuts, taking a wait-and-see approach due to concerns about persistently low inflation. Powell highlighted the importance of gaining confidence in sustainable inflation reaching 2% before easing policy restrictions. The Fed's decision to slow Quantitative Tightening (QT) aims to ensure a smooth transition in reducing its balance sheet without causing market stress, with a plan to eventually eliminate Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) from the balance sheet entirely."

The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index for 20 metros saw a 0.9% increase from December-February, reaching a new high 0.4% above June 2022 levels. Although some cities like San Diego and Los Angeles surpassed their 2022 peaks by a small margin, San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle remained notably below, 12% and 10.6% respectively. Out of the 20 metros, only Tampa and Cleveland experienced a decline in home prices, with Seattle showing the highest monthly increase at 2.3%. San Francisco Bay Area single-family houses have shown +1.7% monthly and +5.7% yearly increases, but are down by -12.0% from the peak in May 2022. Miami stands out as the most splendid housing bubble with home price inflation of 329% since 2000, far exceeding the Consumer Price Index.

Treasury bills under three months have been yielding over 5%, reflecting increased investor interest in short-term, low-risk investments backed by the Fed's rate hikes. As yields continue to rise, banks are compelled to offer competitive rates on CDs to retain and attract deposits, leading to a surge in large and small time-deposits. While T-bills have become popular among investors, banks are cautious about raising deposit rates to prevent a loyalty tax, despite customers having options to earn more elsewhere. This trend highlights the growing preference for secure yet lucrative investment alternatives over traditional bank accounts, as evidenced by the significant balances in retail money market funds reaching $6.36 trillion."

Homeowners holding onto vacant properties in hopes of lower mortgage rates have caused a convergence in prices between new and existing single-family homes. The median price of new homes has fallen more than existing homes, leading to a historic low 5-7% price difference between the two types of properties. Despite high mortgage rates, sales of new houses have remained steady, seeing a modest increase in March compared to a year ago. In contrast, sales of existing homes have plummeted by 29% since January 2019.

        "summary": "The Stratechery article provides insight into the Canadian housing market, noting a -14% dip in home prices from the peak in March 2022, falling below September 2021 levels. Condo prices in Toronto reached a 28-month low, while Vancouver's house prices only decreased by -3.9% from their peak. Calgary's house prices saw an increase to a new high due to the oil boom in the region. Data from the Canadian Real Estate Association shows a 0.7% drop in condo prices in March, with the Composite MLS Home Price Index decreasing by 0.1% from February and 14.1% from its peak in March 2022. Despite a slight increase in home sales, they remain below the 10-year average, even with an uptick in new supply. The Bank of Canada has raised its overnight rate to 5.0% and reduced pandemic QE assets due to inflation concerns, particularly in the rental market from increased immigration. The article also provides a detailed overview of home prices in various Housing-Bubble Markets, including the Greater Toronto Area, Hamilton-Burlington metro, and other cities, illustrating month-to-month changes, peaks, and year-over-year fluctuations in prices for single-family houses and condos in each region."

        "summary": "In a recent article by Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET, Ben, an expert, delved into the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, revealing a surge in inflation driven by services in March. Core services CPI spiked by 5.6% annually, leading to an overall CPI increase not seen since November 2022. The Fed's hopes for a cooldown in inflation have been dashed, with inflation persisting for the third consecutive month. Ben analyzed various components of inflation, noting a significant jump in the \"supercore services CPI\" by 7.5% annually, excluding housing costs. Housing components, including Rent of Primary Residence and Owners' Equivalent of Rent, continued to rise steadily. Durable goods prices dropped by 2.7% in March, with new vehicle prices stabilizing recently. Used vehicle prices also decreased, reversing a portion of the pandemic-induced spike. Food inflation remained stable, with Food at Home CPI unchanged while Food Away from Home saw a 3.2% increase. Energy prices rose for the second consecutive month, influenced by seasonal trends in gasoline prices."

Companies like Progress Residential, Invitation Homes, American Homes 4 Rent, and Blackstone are among the top players in single-family rentals, collectively owning about 2.4% of all single-family rental houses.

        "summary": "In a recent article by Wolf Richter for Wolf Street, Jamie Dimon's concerns about Long-Term Inflation, Fed Interest Rates (\u201c2% to 8% or even more\u201d), and QE/QT (it\u2019s Risky) were highlighted. Dimon emphasized the need for businesses and investors to prepare for a range of potential outcomes rather than relying on specific forecasts due to the unpredictable nature of geopolitical and economic forces. Factors contributing to potential inflation included ongoing fiscal spending, remilitarization, global trade restructuring, green economy capital needs, and higher energy costs. Ben warned about the importance of being ready for interest rates ranging from 2% to 8% or even higher, as different economic scenarios could unfold. He also cautioned about the potential stress on the banking system and leveraged companies if long-term rates exceed 6% during a recession. Concerns were raised about the risks associated with quantitative easing and tightening, with a focus on the significant liquidity drainage through QT exceeding $900 billion annually, representing an unprecedented scale of quantitative tightening."

        "summary": "In a Wolf Street article, Ben from Stratechery analyzes the Bank of Canada's balance sheet normalization strategy, highlighting the significant reduction in pandemic QE assets and Government of Canada bonds. Going forward, the maturity schedule indicates that an additional $65 billion in GoC bonds will mature by September 2025 if Quantitative Tightening (QT) continues. Ben discusses the challenges of withdrawing liquidity and the potential end of QT based on settlement balances, potentially aligning with September 2025. The Bank of Canada's major liabilities, including bank notes in circulation, government deposits, and bank settlement balances, play key roles in shaping the QT process. Once QT concludes, a transition to short-term T-bills and term repos will reshape the balance sheet composition over a multi-year period."

The 10-Year Yield Hits 4.40%, indicating the bond market's acknowledgment of higher inflation rates post-pandemic. This shift contrasts with a previous focus on rate cuts, and the possibility of the yield reaching 5% is now being discussed. The Federal Reserve's reluctance to crash the economy for 2% inflation implies a potential return to 1990s-level inflation, with recent economic growth and labor market strength hinting at a shift towards a more restrictive monetary policy."

        "summary": "In the article, Ben analyzes the recent jobs report, noting that the labor market is robust with 303,000 new payroll jobs created, exceeding expectations and indicating strong job growth. The household data, however, is affected by an underestimation of immigration by the Census Bureau, causing discrepancies in employment and labor force participation figures. Despite this, the total workforce from the household survey is higher than the employer payrolls data, partly due to the immigration miscalculations. The labor force increased by 469,000 to 167.9 million, with stable prime-age labor participation at 83.4%, and a decrease of 29,000 unemployed individuals. Ben delves into unemployment rates, trends among part-time workers, self-employed individuals, and multiple job holders, highlighting the overall soundness of the labor market and arguing against a Fed rate cut."
